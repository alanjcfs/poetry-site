<p>With Pinions of Disdain<br>
The soul can farther fly<br>
Than any feather specified<br>
in Ornithology —<br>
It wafts this sordid Flesh<br>
Beyond its dull — control<br>
And during its electric gale —<br>
The body is a soul —<br>
instructing by the same —<br>
How little work it be —<br>
To put off filaments like this<br>
for immortality</p>
