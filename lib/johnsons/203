<p>He forgot — and I — remembered —<br>
'Twas an everyday affair —<br>
Long ago as Christ and Peter —<br>
"Warmed them" at the "Temple fire."<br>
<br>
"Thou wert with him" — quoth "the Damsel"?<br>
"No" — said Peter, 'twasn't me —<br>
Jesus merely "looked" at Peter —<br>
Could I do aught else — to Thee?</p>
