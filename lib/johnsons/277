<p>What if I say I shall not wait!<br>
What if I burst the fleshly Gate —<br>
And pass escaped — to thee!<br><br>
What if I file this Mortal — off —<br>
See where it hurt me — That's enough —<br>
And wade in Liberty!<br><br>
They cannot take me — any more!<br>
Dungeons can call — and Guns implore<br>
Unmeaning — now — to me —<br><br>
As laughter — was — an hour ago —<br>
Or Laces — or a Travelling Show —<br>
Or who died — yesterday!</p>
