<p>Poor little Heart!<br>
Did they forget thee?<br>
Then dinna care! Then dinna care!<br><br>
Proud little Heart!<br>
Did they forsake thee?<br>
Be debonnaire! Be debonnaire!<br><br>
Frail little Heart!<br>
I would not break thee —<br>
Could'st credit me? Could'st credit me?<br><br>
Gay little Heart —<br>
Like Morning Glory!<br>
Wind and Sun — wilt thee array!</p>
