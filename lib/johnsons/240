<p>Ah, Moon — and Star!<br>
You are very far —<br>
But were no one<br>
Farther than you —<br>
Do you think I'd stop<br>
For a Firmament —<br>
Or a Cubit — or so?<br><br>
I could borrow a Bonnet<br>
Of the Lark —<br>
And a Chamois' Silver Boot —<br>
And a stirrup of an Antelope —<br>
And be with you — Tonight!<br><br>
But, Moon, and Star,<br>
Though you're very far —<br>
There is one — farther than you —<br>
He — is more than a firmament — from Me —<br>
So I can never go!</p>
