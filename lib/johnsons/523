<p>Sweet — You forgot — but I remembered<br>
Every time — for Two —<br>
So that the Sum be never hindered<br>
Through Decay of You —<br><br>
Say if I erred? Accuse my Farthings —<br>
Blame the little Hand<br>
Happy it be for You — a Beggar's —<br>
Seeking More — to spend —<br><br>
Just to be Rich — to waste my Guineas<br>
On so Best a Heart —<br>
Just to be Poor — for Barefoot Vision<br>
You — Sweet — Shut me out —</p>
