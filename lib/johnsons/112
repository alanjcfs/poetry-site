<p>Where bells no more affright the morn —<br>
Where scrabble never comes —<br>
Where very nimble Gentlemen<br>
Are forced to keep their rooms —<br><br>
Where tired Children placid sleep<br>
Thro' Centuries of noon<br>
This place is Bliss — this town is Heaven —<br>
Please, Pater, pretty soon!<br><br>
"Oh could we climb where Moses stood,<br>
And view the Landscape o'er"<br>
Not Father's bells — nor Factories,<br>
Could scare us any more!</p>
