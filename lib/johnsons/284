<p>The Drop, that wrestles in the Sea —<br>
Forgets her own locality —<br>
As I — toward Thee —<br><br>
She knows herself an incense small —<br>
Yet small — she sighs — if All — is All —<br>
How larger — be?<br><br>
The Ocean — smiles — at her Conceit —<br>
But she, forgetting Amphitrite —<br>
Pleads — "Me"?</p>
