<p>Grief is a Mouse —<br>
And chooses Wainscot in the Breast<br>
For His Shy House —<br>
And baffles quest —<br><br>
Grief is a Thief — quick startled —<br>
Pricks His Ear — report to hear<br>
Of that Vast Dark —<br>
That swept His Being — back —<br><br>
Grief is a Juggler — boldest at the Play —<br>
Lest if He flinch — the eye that way<br>
Pounce on His Bruises — One — say — or Three —<br>
Grief is a Gourmand — spare His luxury —<br><br>
Best Grief is Tongueless — before He'll tell —<br>
Burn Him in the Public Square —<br>
His Ashes — will<br>
Possibly — if they refuse — How then know —<br>
Since a Rack couldn't coax a syllable — now.</p>
