<p>The Bone that has no Marrow,<br>
What Ultimate for that?<br>
It is not fit for Table<br>
For Beggar or for Cat.<br><br>
A Bone has obligations —<br>
A Being has the same —<br>
A Marrowless Assembly<br>
Is culpabler than shame.<br><br>
But how shall finished Creatures<br>
A function fresh obtain?<br>
Old Nicodemus' Phantom<br>
Confronting us again!</p>
