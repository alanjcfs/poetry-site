<p>'Twas just this time, last year, I died.<br>
I know I heard the Corn,<br>
When I was carried by the Farms —<br>
It had the Tassels on —<br><br>
I thought how yellow it would look —<br>
When Richard went to mill —<br>
And then, I wanted to get out,<br>
But something held my will.<br><br>
I thought just how Red — Apples wedged<br>
The Stubble's joints between —<br>
And the Carts stooping round the fields<br>
To take the Pumpkins in —<br><br>
I wondered which would miss me, least,<br>
And when Thanksgiving, came,<br>
If Father'd multiply the plates —<br>
To make an even Sum —<br><br>
And would it blur the Christmas glee<br>
My Stocking hang too high<br>
For any Santa Claus to reach<br>
The Altitude of me —<br><br>
But this sort, grieved myself,<br>
And so, I thought the other way,<br>
How just this time, some perfect year —<br>
Themself, should come to me —</p>
