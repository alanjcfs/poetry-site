<p>The Rose did caper on her cheek —<br>
Her Bodice rose and fell —<br>
Her pretty speech — like drunken men —<br>
Did stagger pitiful —<br><br>
Her fingers fumbled at her work —<br>
Her needle would not go —<br>
What ailed so smart a little Maid —<br>
It puzzled me to know —<br><br>
Till opposite — I spied a cheek<br>
That bore another Rose —<br>
Just opposite — Another speech<br>
That like the Drunkard goes —<br><br>
A Vest that like her Bodice, danced —<br>
To the immortal tune —<br>
Till those two troubled — little Clocks<br>
Ticked softly into one.</p>
