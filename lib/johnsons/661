<p>Could I but ride indefinite<br>
As doth the Meadow Bee<br>
And visit only where I liked<br>
And No one visit me<br>
<br>
And flirt all Day with Buttercups<br>
And marry whom I may<br>
And dwell a little everywhere<br>
Or better, run away<br>
<br>
With no Police to follow<br>
Or chase Him if He do<br>
Till He should jump Peninsulas<br>
To get away from me â€”<br>
<br>
I said "But just to be a Bee"<br>
Upon a Raft of Air<br>
And row in Nowhere all Day long<br>
And anchor "off the Bar"<br>
<br>
What Liberty! So Captives deem<br>
Who tight in Dungeons are.</p>
