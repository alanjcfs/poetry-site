<p>This World is not Conclusion.<br>
A Species stands beyond —<br>
Invisible, as Music —<br>
But positive, as Sound —<br>
It beckons, and it baffles —<br>
Philosophy — don't know —<br>
And through a Riddle, at the last —<br>
Sagacity, must go —<br>
To guess it, puzzles scholars —<br>
To gain it, Men have borne<br>
Contempt of Generations<br>
And Crucifixion, shown —<br>
Faith slips — and laughs, and rallies —<br>
Blushes, if any see —<br>
Plucks at a twig of Evidence —<br>
And asks a Vane, the way —<br>
Much Gesture, from the Pulpit —<br>
Strong Hallelujahs roll —<br>
Narcotics cannot still the Tooth<br>
That nibbles at the soul —</p>
