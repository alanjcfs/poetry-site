<p>Delayed till she had ceased to know —<br>
Delayed till in its vest of snow<br>
Her loving bosom lay —<br>
An hour behind the fleeting breath —<br>
Later by just an hour than Death —<br>
Oh lagging Yesterday!<br>
<br>
Could she have guessed that it would be —<br>
Could but a crier of the joy<br>
Have climbed the distant hill —<br>
Had not the bliss so slow a pace<br>
Who knows but this surrendered face<br>
Were undefeated still?<br>
<br>
Oh if there may departing be<br>
Any forgot by Victory<br>
In her imperial round —<br>
Show them this meek appareled thing<br>
That could not stop to be a king —<br>
Doubtful if it be crowned!</p>
