<p>What Twigs We held by —<br>
Oh the View<br>
When Life's swift River striven through<br>
We pause before a further plunge<br>
To take Momentum —<br>
As the Fringe<br><br>
Upon a former Garment shows<br>
The Garment cast,<br>
Our Props disclose<br>
So scant, so eminently small<br>
Of Might to help, so pitiful<br>
To sink, if We had labored, fond<br>
The diligence were not more blind<br><br>
How scant, by everlasting Light<br>
The Discs that satisfied Our Sight —<br>
How dimmer than a Saturn's Bar<br>
The Things esteemed, for Things that are!</p>
