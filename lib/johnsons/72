<p>Glowing is her Bonnet,<br>
Glowing is her Cheek,<br>
Glowing is her Kirtle,<br>
Yet she cannot speak.<br><br>
Better as the Daisy<br>
From the Summer hill<br>
Vanish unrecorded<br>
Save by tearful rill â€”<br><br>
Save by loving sunrise<br>
Looking for her face.<br>
Save by feet unnumbered<br>
Pausing at the place.</p>
