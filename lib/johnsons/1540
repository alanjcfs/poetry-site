<p>As imperceptibly as Grief<br>
The Summer lapsed away —<br>
Too imperceptible at last<br>
To seem like Perfidy —<br>
A Quietness distilled<br>
As Twilight long begun,<br>
Or Nature spending with herself<br>
Sequestered Afternoon —<br>
The Dusk drew earlier in —<br>
The Morning foreign shone —<br>
A courteous, yet harrowing Grace,<br>
As Guest, that would be gone —<br>
And thus, without a Wing<br>
Or service of a Keel<br>
Our Summer made her light escape<br>
Into the Beautiful.</p>
