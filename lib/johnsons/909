<p>I make His Crescent fill or lack —<br>
His Nature is at Full<br>
Or Quarter — as I signify —<br>
His Tides — do I control —<br><br>
He holds superior in the Sky<br>
Or gropes, at my Command<br>
Behind inferior Clouds — or round<br>
A Mist's slow Colonnade —<br><br>
But since We hold a Mutual Disc —<br>
And front a Mutual Day —<br>
Which is the Despot, neither knows —<br>
Nor Whose — the Tyranny —</p>
