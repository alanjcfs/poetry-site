<p>Three Weeks passed since I had seen Her —<br>
Some Disease had vext<br>
'Twas with Text and Village Singing<br>
I beheld Her next<br><br>
And a Company — our pleasure<br>
To discourse alone —<br>
Gracious now to me as any —<br>
Gracious unto none —<br><br>
Borne without dissent of Either<br>
To the Parish night —<br>
Of the Separated Parties<br>
Which be out of sight?</p>
