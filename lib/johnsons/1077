<p>These are the Signs to Nature's Inns —<br>
Her invitation broad<br>
To Whosoever famishing<br>
To taste her mystic Bread —<br><br>
These are the rites of Nature's House —<br>
The Hospitality<br>
That opens with an equal width<br>
To Beggar and to Bee<br><br>
For Sureties of her staunch Estate<br>
Her undecaying Cheer<br>
The Purple in the East is set<br>
And in the North, the Star —</p>
