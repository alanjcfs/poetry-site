<p>When I hoped, I recollect<br>
Just the place I stood —<br>
At a Window facing West —<br>
Roughest Air — was good —<br><br>
Not a Sleet could bite me —<br>
Not a frost could cool —<br>
Hope it was that kept me warm —<br>
Not Merino shawl —<br><br>
When I feared — I recollect<br>
Just the Day it was —<br>
Worlds were lying out to Sun —<br>
Yet how Nature froze —<br><br>
Icicles upon my soul<br>
Prickled Blue and Cool —<br>
Bird went praising everywhere —<br>
Only Me — was still —<br><br>
And the Day that I despaired —<br>
This — if I forget<br>
Nature will — that it be Night<br>
After Sun has set —<br>
Darkness intersect her face —<br>
And put out her eye —<br>
Nature hesitate — before<br>
Memory and I —</p>
