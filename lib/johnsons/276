<p>Many a phrase has the English language —<br>
I have heard but one —<br>
Low as the laughter of the Cricket,<br>
Loud, as the Thunder's Tongue —<br>
<br>
Murmuring, like old Caspian Choirs,<br>
When the Tide's a' lull —<br>
Saying itself in new infection —<br>
Like a Whippoorwill —<br>
<br>
Breaking in bright Orthography<br>
On my simple sleep —<br>
Thundering its Prospective —<br>
Till I stir, and weep —<br>
<br>
Not for the Sorrow, done me —<br>
But the push of Joy —<br>
Say it again, Saxon!<br>
Hush — Only to me!</p>
