<p>I think just how my shape will rise —<br>
When I shall be "forgiven" —<br>
Till Hair — and Eyes — and timid Head —<br>
Are out of sight — in Heaven —<br>
<br>
I think just how my lips will weigh —<br>
With shapeless — quivering — prayer —<br>
That you — so late — "Consider" me —<br>
The "Sparrow" of your Care —<br>
<br>
I mind me that of Anguish — sent —<br>
Some drifts were moved away —<br>
Before my simple bosom — broke —<br>
And why not this — if they?<br>
<br>
And so I con that thing — "forgiven" —<br>
Until — delirious — borne —<br>
By my long bright — and longer — trust —<br>
I drop my Heart — unshriven!</p>
