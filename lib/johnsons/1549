<p>My Wars are laid away in Books —<br>
I have one Battle more —<br>
A Foe whom I have never seen<br>
But oft has scanned me o'er —<br>
And hesitated me between<br>
And others at my side,<br>
But chose the best — Neglecting me — till<br>
All the rest, have died —<br>
How sweet if I am not forgot<br>
By Chums that passed away —<br>
Since Playmates at threescore and ten<br>
Are such a scarcity —</p>
