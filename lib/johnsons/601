<p>A still — Volcano — Life —<br>
That flickered in the night —<br>
When it was dark enough to do<br>
Without erasing sight —<br><br>
A quiet — Earthquake Style —<br>
Too subtle to suspect<br>
By natures this side Naples —<br>
The North cannot detect<br><br>
The Solemn — Torrid — Symbol —<br>
The lips that never lie —<br>
Whose hissing Corals part — and shut —<br>
And Cities — ooze away —</p>
