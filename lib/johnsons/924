<p>Love — is that later Thing than Death —<br>
More previous — than Life —<br>
Confirms it at its entrance — And<br>
Usurps it — of itself —<br><br>
Tastes Death — the first — to hand the sting<br>
The Second — to its friend —<br>
Disarms the little interval —<br>
Deposits Him with God —<br><br>
Then hovers — an inferior Guard —<br>
Lest this Beloved Charge<br>
Need — once in an Eternity —<br>
A smaller than the Large —</p>
