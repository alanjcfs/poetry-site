<p>Before the ice is in the pools —<br>
Before the skaters go,<br>
Or any check at nightfall<br>
Is tarnished by the snow —<br>
<br>
Before the fields have finished,<br>
Before the Christmas tree,<br>
Wonder upon wonder<br>
Will arrive to me!<br>
<br>
What we touch the hems of<br>
On a summer's day —<br>
What is only walking<br>
Just a bridge away —<br>
<br>
That which sings so — speaks so —<br>
When there's no one here —<br>
Will the frock I wept in<br>
Answer me to wear?</p>
