<p>Just lost, when I was saved!<br>
Just felt the world go by!<br>
Just girt me for the onset with Eternity,<br>
When breath blew back,<br>
And on the other side<br>
I heard recede the disappointed tide!<br><br>
Therefore, as One returned, I feel<br>
Odd secrets of the line to tell!<br>
Some Sailor, skirting foreign shores —<br>
Some pale Reporter, from the awful doors<br>
Before the Seal!<br><br>
Next time, to stay!<br>
Next time, the things to see<br>
By Ear unheard,<br>
Unscrutinized by Eye —<br><br>
Next time, to tarry,<br>
While the Ages steal —<br>
Slow tramp the Centuries,<br>
And the Cycles wheel!</p>
