<p>The farthest Thunder that I heard<br>
Was nearer than the Sky<br>
And rumbles still, though torrid Noons<br>
Have lain their missiles by —<br>
The Lightning that preceded it<br>
Struck no one but myself —<br>
But I would not exchange the Bolt<br>
For all the rest of Life —<br>
Indebtedness to Oxygen<br>
The Happy may repay,<br>
But not the obligation<br>
To Electricity —<br>
It founds the Homes and decks the Days<br>
And every clamor bright<br>
Is but the gleam concomitant<br>
Of that waylaying Light —<br>
The Thought is quiet as a Flake —<br>
A Crash without a Sound,<br>
How Life's reverberation<br>
Its Explanation found —</p>
