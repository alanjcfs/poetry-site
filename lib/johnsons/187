<p>How many times these low feet staggered —<br>
Only the soldered mouth can tell —<br>
Try — can you stir the awful rivet —<br>
Try — can you lift the hasps of steel!<br>
<br>
Stroke the cool forehead — hot so often —<br>
Lift — if you care — the listless hair —<br>
Handle the adamantine fingers<br>
Never a thimble — more — shall wear —<br>
<br>
Buzz the dull flies — on the chamber window —<br>
Brave — shines the sun through the freckled pane —<br>
Fearless — the cobweb swings from the ceiling —<br>
Indolent Housewife — in Daisies — lain!</p>
