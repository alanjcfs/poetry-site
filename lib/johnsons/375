<p>The Angle of a Landscape —<br>
That every time I wake —<br>
Between my Curtain and the Wall<br>
Upon an ample Crack —<br><br>
Like a Venetian — waiting —<br>
Accosts my open eye —<br>
Is just a Bough of Apples —<br>
Held slanting, in the Sky —<br><br>
The Pattern of a Chimney —<br>
The Forehead of a Hill —<br>
Sometimes — a Vane's Forefinger —<br>
But that's — Occasional —<br><br>
The Seasons — shift — my Picture —<br>
Upon my Emerald Bough,<br>
I wake — to find no — Emeralds —<br>
Then — Diamonds — which the Snow<br><br>
From Polar Caskets — fetched me —<br>
The Chimney — and the Hill —<br>
And just the Steeple's finger —<br>
These — never stir at all —</p>
