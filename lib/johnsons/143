<p>For every Bird a Nest —<br>
Wherefore in timid quest<br>
Some little Wren goes seeking round —<br>
<br>
Wherefore when boughs are free —<br>
Households in every tree —<br>
Pilgrim be found?<br>
<br>
Perhaps a home too high —<br>
Ah Aristocracy!<br>
The little Wren desires —<br>
<br>
Perhaps of twig so fine —<br>
Of twine e'en superfine,<br>
Her pride aspires —<br>
<br>
The Lark is not ashamed<br>
To build upon the ground<br>
Her modest house —<br>
<br>
Yet who of all the throng<br>
Dancing around the sun<br>
Does so rejoice?</p>
