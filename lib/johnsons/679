<p>Conscious am I in my Chamber,<br>
Of a shapeless friend —<br>
He doth not attest by Posture —<br>
Nor Confirm — by Word —<br>
<br>
Neither Place — need I present Him —<br>
Fitter Courtesy<br>
Hospitable intuition<br>
Of His Company —<br>
<br>
Presence — is His furthest license —<br>
Neither He to Me<br>
Nor Myself to Him — by Accent —<br>
Forfeit Probity —<br>
<br>
Weariness of Him, were quainter<br>
Than Monotony<br>
Knew a Particle — of Space's<br>
Vast Society<br>
<br>
Neither if He visit Other —<br>
Do He dwell — or Nay — know I —<br>
But Instinct esteem Him<br>
Immortality —</p>
