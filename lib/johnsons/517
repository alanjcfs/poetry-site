<p>He parts Himself — like Leaves —<br>
And then — He closes up —<br>
Then stands upon the Bonnet<br>
Of Any Buttercup —<br><br>
And then He runs against<br>
And oversets a Rose —<br>
And then does Nothing —<br>
Then away upon a Jib — He goes —<br><br>
And dangles like a Mote<br>
Suspended in the Noon —<br>
Uncertain — to return Below —<br>
Or settle in the Moon —<br><br>
What come of Him — at Night —<br>
The privilege to say<br>
Be limited by Ignorance —<br>
What come of Him — That Day —<br><br>
The Frost — possess the World —<br>
In Cabinets — be shown —<br>
A Sepulchre of quaintest Floss —<br>
An Abbey — a Cocoon —</p>
