<p>Wait till the Majesty of Death<br>
Invests so mean a brow!<br>
Almost a powdered Footman<br>
Might dare to touch it now!<br><br>
Wait till in Everlasting Robes<br>
That Democrat is dressed,<br>
Then prate about "Preferment" â€”<br>
And "Station," and the rest!<br><br>
Around this quiet Courtier<br>
Obsequious Angels wait!<br>
Full royal is his Retinue!<br>
Full purple is his state!<br><br>
A Lord, might dare to lift the Hat<br>
To such a Modest Clay<br>
Since that My Lord, "the Lord of Lords"<br>
Receives unblushingly!</p>
