<p>It did not surprise me —<br>
So I said — or thought —<br>
She will stir her pinions<br>
And the nest forgot,<br>
<br>
Traverse broader forests —<br>
Build in gayer boughs,<br>
Breathe in Ear more modern<br>
God's old fashioned vows —<br>
<br>
This was but a Birdling —<br>
What and if it be<br>
One within my bosom<br>
Had departed me?<br>
<br>
This was but a story —<br>
What and if indeed<br>
There were just such coffin<br>
In the heart instead?</p>
