<p>Joy to have merited the Pain —<br>
To merit the Release —<br>
Joy to have perished every step —<br>
To Compass Paradise —<br><br>
Pardon — to look upon thy face —<br>
With these old fashioned Eyes —<br>
Better than new — could be — for that —<br>
Though bought in Paradise —<br><br>
Because they looked on thee before —<br>
And thou hast looked on them —<br>
Prove Me — My Hazel Witnesses<br>
The features are the same —<br><br>
So fleet thou wert, when present —<br>
So infinite — when gone —<br>
An Orient's Apparition —<br>
Remanded of the Morn —<br><br>
The Height I recollect —<br>
'Twas even with the Hills —<br>
The Depth upon my Soul was notched —<br>
As Floods — on Whites of Wheels —<br><br>
To Haunt — till Time have dropped<br>
His last Decade away,<br>
And Haunting actualize — to last<br>
At least — Eternity —</p>
