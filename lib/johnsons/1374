<p>A Saucer holds a Cup<br>
In sordid human Life<br>
But in a Squirrel's estimate<br>
A Saucer hold a Loaf.<br><br>
A Table of a Tree<br>
Demands the little King<br>
And every Breeze that run along<br>
His Dining Room do swing.<br><br>
His Cutlery — he keeps<br>
Within his Russer Lips —<br>
To see it flashing when he dines<br>
Do Birmingham eclipse —<br><br>
Convicted — could we be<br>
Of our Minutiae<br>
The smallest Citizen that flies<br>
Is heartier than we —</p>
