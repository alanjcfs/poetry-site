<p>Unit, like Death, for Whom?<br>
True, like the Tomb,<br>
Who tells no secret<br>
Told to Him —<br>
The Grave is strict —<br>
Tickets admit<br>
Just two — the Bearer —<br>
And the Borne —<br>
And seat — just One —<br>
The Living — tell —<br>
The Dying — but a Syllable —<br>
The Coy Dead — None —<br>
No Chatter — here — no tea —<br>
So Babbler, and Bohea — stay there —<br>
But Gravity — and Expectation — and Fear —<br>
A tremor just, that All's not sure.</p>
