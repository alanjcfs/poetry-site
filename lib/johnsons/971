<p>Robbed by Death — but that was easy —<br>
To the failing Eye<br>
I could hold the latest Glowing —<br>
Robbed by Liberty<br><br>
For Her Jugular Defences —<br>
This, too, I endured —<br>
Hint of Glory — it afforded —<br>
For the Brave Beloved —<br><br>
Fraud of Distance — Fraud of Danger,<br>
Fraud of Death — to bear —<br>
It is Bounty — to Suspense's<br>
Vague Calamity —<br><br>
Stalking our entire Possession<br>
On a Hair's result —<br>
Then — seesawing — coolly — on it —<br>
Trying if it split —</p>
