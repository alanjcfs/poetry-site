<p>Precious to Me — She still shall be —<br>
Though She forget the name I bear —<br>
The fashion of the Gown I wear —<br>
The very Color of My Hair —<br><br>
So like the Meadows — now —<br>
I dared to show a Tress of Theirs<br>
If haply — She might not despise<br>
A Buttercup's Array —<br><br>
I know the Whole — obscures the Part —<br>
The fraction — that appeased the Heart<br>
Till Number's Empery —<br>
Remembered — as the Millner's flower<br><br>
When Summer's Everlasting Dower —<br>
Confronts the dazzled Bee.</p>
