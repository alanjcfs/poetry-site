<p>After great pain, a formal feeling comes —<br>
The Nerves sit ceremonious, like Tombs —<br>
The stiff Heart questions was it He, that bore,<br>
And Yesterday, or Centuries before?<br><br>
The Feet, mechanical, go round —<br>
Of Ground, or Air, or Ought —<br>
A Wooden way<br>
Regardless grown,<br>
A Quartz contentment, like a stone —<br><br>
This is the Hour of Lead —<br>
Remembered, if outlived,<br>
As Freezing persons, recollect the Snow —<br>
First — Chill — then Stupor — then the letting go —</p>
