<p>This was a Poet — It is That<br>
Distills amazing sense<br>
From ordinary Meanings —<br>
And Attar so immense<br><br>
From the familiar species<br>
That perished by the Door —<br>
We wonder it was not Ourselves<br>
Arrested it — before —<br><br>
Of Pictures, the Discloser —<br>
The Poet — it is He —<br>
Entitles Us — by Contrast —<br>
To ceaseless Poverty —<br><br>
Of portion — so unconscious —<br>
The Robbing — could not harm —<br>
Himself — to Him — a Fortune —<br>
Exterior — to Time —</p>
