<p>Savior! I've no one else to tell —<br>
And so I trouble thee.<br>
I am the one forgot thee so —<br>
Dost thou remember me?<br>
Nor, for myself, I came so far —<br>
That were the little load —<br>
I brought thee the imperial Heart<br>
I had not strength to hold —<br>
The Heart I carried in my own —<br>
Till mine too heavy grew —<br>
Yet — strangest — heavier since it went —<br>
Is it too large for you?</p>
