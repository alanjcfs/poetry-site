<p>Forget! The lady with the Amulet<br>
Forget she wore it at her Heart<br>
Because she breathed against<br>
Was Treason twixt?<br><br>
Deny! Did Rose her Bee —<br>
For Privilege of Play<br>
Or Wile of Butterfly<br>
Or Opportunity — Her Lord away?<br><br>
The lady with the Amulet — will face —<br>
The Bee — in Mausoleum laid —<br>
Discard his Bride —<br>
But longer than the little Rill —<br>
That cooled the Forehead of the Hill —<br>
While Other — went the Sea to fill —<br>
And Other — went to turn the Mill —<br>
I'll do thy Will —</p>
