<p>The Sun — just touched the Morning —<br>
The Morning — Happy thing —<br>
Supposed that He had come to dwell —<br>
And Life would all be Spring!<br><br>
She felt herself supremer —<br>
A Raised — Ethereal Thing!<br>
Henceforth — for Her — What Holiday!<br>
Meanwhile — Her wheeling King —<br>
Trailed — slow — along the Orchards —<br>
His haughty — spangled Hems —<br>
Leaving a new necessity!<br>
The want of Diadems!<br><br>
The Morning — fluttered — staggered —<br>
Felt feebly — for Her Crown —<br>
Her unanointed forehead —<br>
Henceforth — Her only One!</p>
