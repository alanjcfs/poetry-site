    And when his golden walk is done,<br>
  Sits shyly at his feet.<br>
He, walking, finds the flower near.<br>
"Wherefore, marauder, art thou here ?<br>
  "Because, sir, love is sweet !"<br><br>
We are the flower, Thou the sun !<br>
Forgive us, if as days decline,<br>
  We nearer steal to Thee, —<br>
Enamoured of the parting west,<br>
The peace, the flight, the amethyst,<br>
  Night's possibility !</p>
