<p>She's happy, with a new Content —<br>
That feels to her — like Sacrament —<br>
She's busy — with an altered Care —<br>
As just apprenticed to the Air —<br><br>
She's tearful — if she weep at all —<br>
For blissful Causes — Most of all<br>
That Heaven permit so meek as her —<br>
To such a Fate — to Minister.</p>
