<p>The duties of the Wind are few,<br>
To cast the ships, at Sea,<br>
Establish March, the Floods escort,<br>
And usher Liberty.<br><br>
The pleasures of the Wind are broad,<br>
To dwell Extent among,<br>
Remain, or wander,<br>
Speculate, or Forests entertain.<br><br>
The kinsmen of the Wind are Peaks<br>
Azof â€” the Equinox,<br>
Also with Bird and Asteroid<br>
A bowing intercourse.<br><br>
The limitations of the Wind<br>
Do he exist, or die,<br>
Too wise he seems for Wakelessness,<br>
However, know not i.</p>
