<p>One Life of so much Consequence!<br>
Yet I — for it — would pay —<br>
My Soul's entire income —<br>
In ceaseless — salary —<br><br>
One Pearl — to me — so signal —<br>
That I would instant dive —<br>
Although — I knew — to take it —<br>
Would cost me — just a life!<br><br>
The Sea is full — I know it!<br>
That — does not blur my Gem!<br>
It burns — distinct from all the row —<br>
Intact — in Diadem!<br><br>
The life is thick — I know it!<br>
Yet — not so dense a crowd —<br>
But Monarchs — are perceptible —<br>
Far down the dustiest Road!</p>
