<p>Like Rain it sounded till it curved<br>
And then I new 'twas Wind —<br>
It walked as wet as any Wave<br>
But swept as dry as sand —<br>
When it had pushed itself away<br>
To some remotest Plain<br>
A coming as of Hosts was heard<br>
It filled the Wells, it pleased the Pools<br>
It warbled in the Road —<br>
It pulled the spigot from the Hills<br>
And let the Floods abroad —<br>
It loosened acres, lifted seas<br>
The sites of Centres stirred<br>
Then like Elijah rode away<br>
Upon a Wheel of Cloud.</p>
