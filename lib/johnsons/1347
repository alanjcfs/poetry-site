<p>Escape is such a thankful Word<br>
I often in the Night<br>
Consider it unto myself<br>
No spectacle in sight<br><br>
Escape — it is the Basket<br>
In which the Heart is caught<br>
When down some awful Battlement<br>
The rest of Life is dropt —<br><br>
'Tis not to sight the savior —<br>
It is to be the saved —<br>
And that is why I lay my Head<br>
Upon this trusty word —</p>
