<p>Frequently the woods are pink —<br>
Frequently are brown.<br>
Frequently the hills undress<br>
Behind my native town.<br>
Oft a head is crested<br>
I was wont to see —<br>
And as oft a cranny<br>
Where it used to be —<br>
And the Earth — they tell me —<br>
On it's axis turned!<br>
Wonderful Rotation!<br>
By but <i>twelve</i> performed!</p>
