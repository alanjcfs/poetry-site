<p>The first Day's Night had come —<br>
And grateful that a thing<br>
So terrible — had been endured —<br>
I told my Soul to sing —<br><br>
She said her Strings were snapt —<br>
Her Bow — to Atoms blown —<br>
And so to mend her — gave me work<br>
Until another Morn —<br><br>
And then — a Day as huge<br>
As Yesterdays in pairs,<br>
Unrolled its horror in my face —<br>
Until it blocked my eyes —<br><br>
My Brain — begun to laugh —<br>
I mumbled — like a fool —<br>
And tho' 'tis Years ago — that Day —<br>
My Brain keeps giggling — still.<br><br>
And Something's odd — within —<br>
That person that I was —<br>
And this One — do not feel the same —<br>
Could it be Madness — this?</p>
