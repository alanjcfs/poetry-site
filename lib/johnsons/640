<p>I cannot live with You —<br>
It would be Life —<br>
And Life is over there —<br>
Behind the Shelf<br><br>
The Sexton keeps the Key to —<br>
Putting up<br>
Our Life — His Porcelain —<br>
Like a Cup —<br><br>
Discarded of the Housewife —<br>
Quaint — or Broke —<br>
A newer Sevres pleases —<br>
Old Ones crack —<br><br>
I could not die — with You —<br>
For One must wait<br>
To shut the Other's Gaze down —<br>
You — could not —<br><br>
And I — Could I stand by<br>
And see You — freeze —<br>
Without my Right of Frost —<br>
Death's privilege?<br><br>
Nor could I rise — with You —<br>
Because Your Face<br>
Would put out Jesus' —<br>
That New Grace<br><br>
Glow plain — and foreign<br>
On my homesick Eye —<br>
Except that You than He<br>
Shone closer by —<br><br>
They'd judge Us — How —<br>
For You — served Heaven — You know,<br>
Or sought to —<br>
I could not —<br><br>
Because You saturated Sight —<br>
And I had no more Eyes<br>
For sordid excellence<br>
As Paradise<br><br>
And were You lost, I would be —<br>
Though My Name<br>
Rang loudest<br>
On the Heavenly fame —<br><br>
And were You — saved —<br>
And I — condemned to be<br>
Where You were not —<br>
That self — were Hell to Me —<br><br>
So We must meet apart —<br>
You there — I — here —<br>
With just the Door ajar<br>
That Oceans are — and Prayer —<br>
And that White Sustenance —<br>
Despair —</p>
