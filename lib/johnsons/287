<p>A Clock stopped —<br>
Not the Mantel's —<br>
Geneva's farthest skill<br>
Can't put the puppet bowing —<br>
That just now dangled still —<br><br>
An awe came on the Trinket!<br>
The Figures hunched, with pain —<br>
Then quivered out of Decimals —<br>
Into Degreeless Noon —<br><br>
It will not stir for Doctors —<br>
This Pendulum of snow —<br>
This Shopman importunes it —<br>
While cool — concernless No —<br><br>
Nods from the Gilded pointers —<br>
Nods from the Seconds slim —<br>
Decades of Arrogance between<br>
The Dial life —<br>
And Him —</p>
