<p>While we were fearing it, it came —<br>
But came with less of fear<br>
Because that fearing it so long<br>
Had almost made it fair —<br><br>
There is a Fitting — a Dismay —<br>
A Fitting — a Despair<br>
'Tis harder knowing it is Due<br>
Than knowing it is Here.<br><br>
They Trying on the Utmost<br>
The Morning it is new<br>
Is Terribler than wearing it<br>
A whole existence through.</p>
