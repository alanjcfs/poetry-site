<p>A Drunkard cannot meet a Cork<br>
Without a Revery —<br>
And so encountering a Fly<br>
This January Day<br>
Jamaicas of Remembrance stir<br>
That send me reeling in —<br>
The moderate drinker of Delight<br>
Does not deserve the spring —<br>
Of juleps, part are the Jug<br>
And more are in the joy —<br>
Your connoisseur in Liquours<br>
Consults the Bumble Bee —</p>
