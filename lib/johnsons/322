<p>There came a Day at Summer's full,<br>
Entirely for me —<br>
I thought that such were for the Saints,<br>
Where Resurrections — be —<br><br>
The Sun, as common, went abroad,<br>
The flowers, accustomed, blew,<br>
As if no soul the solstice passed<br>
That maketh all things new —<br><br>
The time was scarce profaned, by speech —<br>
The symbol of a word<br>
Was needless, as at Sacrament,<br>
The Wardrobe — of our Lord —<br><br>
Each was to each The Sealed Church,<br>
Permitted to commune this — time —<br>
Lest we too awkward show<br>
At Supper of the Lamb.<br><br>
The Hours slid fast — as Hours will,<br>
Clutched tight, by greedy hands —<br>
So faces on two Decks, look back,<br>
Bound to opposing lands —<br><br>
And so when all the time had leaked,<br>
Without external sound<br>
Each bound the Other's Crucifix —<br>
We gave no other Bond —<br><br>
Sufficient troth, that we shall rise —<br>
Deposed — at length, the Grave —<br>
To that new Marriage,<br>
Justified — through Calvaries of Love —</p>
