<p>The Brain — is wider than the Sky —<br>
For — put them side by side —<br>
The one the other will contain<br>
With ease — and You — beside —<br><br>
The Brain is deeper than the sea —<br>
For — hold them — Blue to Blue —<br>
The one the other will absorb —<br>
As Sponges — Buckets — do —<br><br>
The Brain is just the weight of God —<br>
For — Heft them — Pound for Pound —<br>
And they will differ — if they do —<br>
As Syllable from Sound —</p>
