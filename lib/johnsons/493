<p>The World — stands — solemner — to me —<br>
Since I was wed — to Him —<br>
A modesty befits the soul<br>
That bears another's — name —<br>
A doubt — if it be fair — indeed —<br>
To wear that perfect — pearl —<br>
The Man — upon the Woman — binds —<br>
To clasp her soul — for all —<br>
A prayer, that it more angel — prove —<br>
A whiter Gift — within —<br>
To that munificence, that chose —<br>
So unadorned — a Queen —<br>
A Gratitude — that such be true —<br>
It had esteemed the Dream —<br>
Too beautiful — for Shape to prove —<br>
Or posture — to redeem!</p>
