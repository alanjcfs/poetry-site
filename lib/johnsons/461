<p>A Wife — at daybreak I shall be —<br>
Sunrise — Hast thou a Flag for me?<br>
At Midnight, I am but a Maid,<br>
How short it takes to make a Bride —<br>
Then — Midnight, I have passed from thee<br>
Unto the East, and Victory —<br><br>
Midnight — Good Night! I hear them call,<br>
The Angels bustle in the Hall —<br>
Softly my Future climbs the Stair,<br>
I fumble at my Childhood's prayer<br>
So soon to be a Child no more —<br>
Eternity, I'm coming — Sire,<br>
Savior — I've seen the face — before!</p>
