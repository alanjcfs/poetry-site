<p>One Year ago — jots what?<br>
God — spell the word! I — can't —<br>
Was't Grace? Not that —<br>
Was't Glory? That — will do —<br>
Spell slower — Glory —<br><br>
Such Anniversary shall be —<br>
Sometimes — not often — in Eternity —<br>
When farther Parted, than the Common Woe —<br>
Look — feed upon each other's faces — so —<br>
In doubtful meal, if it be possible<br>
Their Banquet's true —<br><br>
I tasted — careless — then —<br>
I did not know the Wine<br>
Came once a World — Did you?<br>
Oh, had you told me so —<br>
This Thirst would blister — easier — now —<br>
You said it hurt you — most —<br>
Mine — was an Acorn's Breast —<br>
And could not know how fondness grew<br>
In Shaggier Vest —<br>
Perhaps — I couldn't —<br>
But, had you looked in —<br>
A Giant — eye to eye with you, had been —<br>
No Acorn — then —<br><br>
So — Twelve months ago —<br>
We breathed —<br>
Then dropped the Air —<br>
Which bore it best?<br>
Was this — the patientest —<br>
Because it was a Child, you know —<br>
And could not value — Air?<br><br>
If to be "Elder" — mean most pain —<br>
I'm old enough, today, I'm certain — then —<br>
As old as thee — how soon?<br>
One — Birthday more — or Ten?<br>
Let me — choose!<br>
Ah, Sir, None!</p>
