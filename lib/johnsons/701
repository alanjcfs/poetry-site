<p>A Thought went up my mind today —<br>
That I have had before —<br>
But did not finish — some way back —<br>
I could not fix the Year —<br><br>
Nor where it went — nor why it came<br>
The second time to me —<br>
Nor definitely, what it was —<br>
Have I the Art to say —<br><br>
But somewhere — in my Soul — I know —<br>
I've met the Thing before —<br>
It just reminded me — 'twas all —<br>
And came my way no more —</p>
