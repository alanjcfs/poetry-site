<p>Bound — a trouble —<br>
And lives can bear it!<br>
Limit — how deep a bleeding go!<br>
So — many — drops — of vital scarlet —<br>
Deal with the soul<br>
As with Algebra!<br>
<br>
Tell it the Ages — to a cypher —<br>
And it will ache — contented — on —<br>
Sing — at its pain — as any Workman —<br>
Notching the fall of the Even Sun!</p>
