<p>I measure every Grief I meet<br>
With narrow, probing, Eyes —<br>
I wonder if It weighs like Mine —<br>
Or has an Easier size.<br><br>
I wonder if They bore it long —<br>
Or did it just begin —<br>
I could not tell the Date of Mine —<br>
It feels so old a pain —<br><br>
I wonder if it hurts to live —<br>
And if They have to try —<br>
And whether — could They choose between —<br>
It would not be — to die —<br><br>
I note that Some — gone patient long —<br>
At length, renew their smile —<br>
An imitation of a Light<br>
That has so little Oil —<br><br>
I wonder if when Years have piled —<br>
Some Thousands — on the Harm —<br>
That hurt them early — such a lapse<br>
Could give them any Balm —<br><br>
Or would they go on aching still<br>
Through Centuries of Nerve —<br>
Enlightened to a larger Pain -<br>
In Contrast with the Love —<br><br>
The Grieved — are many — I am told —<br>
There is the various Cause —<br>
Death — is but one — and comes but once —<br>
And only nails the eyes —<br><br>
There's Grief of Want — and Grief of Cold —<br>
A sort they call "Despair" —<br>
There's Banishment from native Eyes —<br>
In sight of Native Air —<br><br>
And though I may not guess the kind —<br>
Correctly — yet to me<br>
A piercing Comfort it affords<br>
In passing Calvary —<br><br>
To note the fashions — of the Cross —<br>
And how they're mostly worn —<br>
Still fascinated to presume<br>
That Some — are like My Own —</p>
