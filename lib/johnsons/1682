<p>Summer begins to have the look<br>
Peruser of enchanting Book<br>
Reluctantly but sure perceives<br>
A gain upon the backward leaves â€”<br><br>
Autumn begins to be inferred<br>
By millinery of the cloud<br>
Or deeper color in the shawl<br>
That wraps the everlasting hill.<br><br>
The eye begins its avarice<br>
A meditation chastens speech<br>
Some Dyer of a distant tree<br>
Resumes his gaudy industry.<br><br>
Conclusion is the course of All<br>
At most to be perennial<br>
And then elude stability<br>
Recalls to immortality.</p>
