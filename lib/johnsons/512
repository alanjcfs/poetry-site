<p>The Soul has Bandaged moments —<br>
When too appalled to stir —<br>
She feels some ghastly Fright come up<br>
And stop to look at her —<br><br>
Salute her — with long fingers —<br>
Caress her freezing hair —<br>
Sip, Goblin, from the very lips<br>
The Lover — hovered — o'er —<br>
Unworthy, that a thought so mean<br>
Accost a Theme — so — fair —<br><br>
The soul has moments of Escape —<br>
When bursting all the doors —<br>
She dances like a Bomb, abroad,<br>
And swings upon the Hours,<br><br>
As do the Bee — delirious borne —<br>
Long Dungeoned from his Rose —<br>
Touch Liberty — then know no more,<br>
But Noon, and Paradise —<br><br>
The Soul's retaken moments —<br>
When, Felon led along,<br>
With shackles on the plumed feet,<br>
And staples, in the Song,<br><br>
The Horror welcomes her, again,<br>
These, are not brayed of Tongue —</p>
