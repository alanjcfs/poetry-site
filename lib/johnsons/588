<p>I cried at Pity — not at Pain —<br>
I heard a Woman say<br>
"Poor Child" — and something in her voice<br>
Convicted me — of me —<br><br>
So long I fainted, to myself<br>
It seemed the common way,<br>
And Health, and Laughter, Curious things —<br>
To look at, like a Toy —<br><br>
To sometimes hear "Rich people" buy<br>
And see the Parcel rolled —<br>
And carried, I supposed — to Heaven,<br>
For children, made of Gold —<br><br>
But not to touch, or wish for,<br>
Or think of, with a sigh —<br>
And so and so — had been to me,<br>
Had God willed differently.<br><br>
I wish I knew that Woman's name —<br>
So when she comes this way,<br>
To hold my life, and hold my ears<br>
For fear I hear her say<br><br>
She's "sorry I am dead" — again —<br>
Just when the Grave and I —<br>
Have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep,<br>
Our only Lullaby —</p>
