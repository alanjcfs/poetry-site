<p>The Fingers of the Light<br>
Tapped soft upon the Town<br>
With "I am great and cannot wait<br>
So therefore let me in."<br><br>
"You're soon," the Town replied,<br>
"My Faces are asleep â€”<br>
But swear, and I will let you by,<br>
You will not wake them up."<br><br>
The easy Guest complied<br>
But once within the Town<br>
The transport of His Countenance<br>
Awakened Maid and Man<br><br>
The Neighbor in the Pool<br>
Upon His Hip elate<br>
Made loud obeisance and the Gnat<br>
Held up His Cup for Light.</p>
