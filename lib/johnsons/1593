<p>There came a Wind like a Bugle —<br>
It quivered through the Grass<br>
And a Green Chill upon the Heat<br>
So ominous did pass<br>
We barred the Windows and the Doors<br>
As from an Emerald Ghost —<br>
The Doom's electric Moccasin<br>
That very instant passed —<br>
On a strange Mob of panting Trees<br>
And Fences fled away<br>
And Rivers where the Houses ran<br>
Those looked that lived — that Day —<br>
The Bell within the steeple wild<br>
The flying tidings told —<br>
How much can come<br>
And much can go,<br>
And yet abide the World!</p>
