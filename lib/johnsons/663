<p>Again — his voice is at the door —<br>
I feel the old Degree —<br>
I hear him ask the servant<br>
For such an one — as me —<br><br>
I take a flower — as I go —<br>
My face to justify —<br>
He never saw me — in this life —<br>
I might surprise his eye!<br><br>
I cross the Hall with mingled steps —<br>
I — silent — pass the door —<br>
I look on all this world contains —<br>
Just his face — nothing more!<br><br>
We talk in careless — and it toss —<br>
A kind of plummet strain —<br>
Each — sounding — shyly —<br>
Just — how — deep —<br>
The other's one — had been —<br><br>
We walk — I leave my Dog — at home —<br>
A tender — thoughtful Moon —<br>
Goes with us — just a little way —<br>
And — then — we are alone —<br><br>
Alone — if Angels are "alone" —<br>
First time they try the sky!<br>
Alone — if those "veiled faces" — be —<br>
We cannot count — on High!<br><br>
I'd give — to live that hour — again —<br>
The purple — in my Vein —<br>
But He must count the drops — himself —<br>
My price for every stain!</p>
