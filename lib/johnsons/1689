<p>The look of thee, what is it like<br>
Hast thou a hand or Foot<br>
Or Mansion of Identity<br>
And what is thy Pursuit?<br><br>
Thy fellows are they realms or Themes<br>
Hast thou Delight or Fear<br>
Or Longing — and is that for us<br>
Or values more severe?<br><br>
Let change transfuse all other Traits<br>
Enact all other Blame<br>
But deign this least certificate —<br>
That thou shalt be the same.</p>
