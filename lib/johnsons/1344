<p>Not any more to be lacked —<br>
Not any more to be known —<br>
Denizen of Significance<br>
For a span so worn —<br><br>
Even Nature herself<br>
Has forgot it is there —<br>
Sedulous of her Multitudes<br>
Notwithstanding Despair —<br><br>
Of the Ones that pursued it<br>
Suing it not to go<br>
Some have solaced the longing<br>
To accompany —<br><br>
Some — rescinded the Wrench —<br>
Others — Shall I say<br>
Plated the residue of Adz<br>
With Monotony.</p>
