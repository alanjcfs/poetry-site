<p>No Rack can torture me —<br>
My Soul — at Liberty —<br>
Behind this mortal Bone<br>
There knits a bolder One —<br>
<br>
You cannot prick with saw —<br>
Nor pierce with Scimitar —<br>
Two Bodies — therefore be —<br>
Bind One — The Other fly —<br>
<br>
The Eagle of his Nest<br>
No easier divest —<br>
And gain the Sky<br>
Than mayest Thou —<br>
<br>
Except Thyself may be<br>
Thine Enemy —<br>
Captivity is Consciousness —<br>
So's Liberty.</p>
