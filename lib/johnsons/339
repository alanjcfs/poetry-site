<p>I tend my flowers for thee —<br>
Bright Absentee!<br>
My Fuchsia's Coral Seams<br>
Rip — while the Sower — dreams<br>
<br>
Geraniums — tint — and spot —<br>
Low Daisies — dot —<br>
My Cactus — splits her Beard<br>
To show her throat —<br>
<br>
Carnations — tip their spice —<br>
And Bees — pick up —<br>
A Hyacinth — I hid —<br>
Puts out a Ruffled Head —<br>
And odors fall<br>
From flasks — so small —<br>
You marvel how they held —<br>
<br>
Globe Roses — break their satin flake —<br>
Upon my Garden floor<br>
Yet — thou — not there —<br>
I had as lief they bore<br>
No Crimson — more —<br>
<br>
Thy flower — be gay —<br>
Her Lord — away!<br>
It ill becometh me —<br>
I'll dwell in Calyx — Gray —<br>
How modestly — alway —<br>
Thy Daisy —<br>
Draped for thee!</p>
