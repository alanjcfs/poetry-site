<p>With sweetness unabated<br>
Informed the hour had come<br>
With no remiss of triumph<br>
The autumn started home<br><br>
Her home to be with Nature<br>
As competition done<br>
By influential kinsmen<br>
Invited to return —<br><br>
In supplements of Purple<br>
An adequate repast<br>
In heavenly reviewing<br>
Her residue be past —</p>
