<p>There's a certain Slant of light,<br>
Winter Afternoons –<br>
That oppresses, like the Heft<br>
Of Cathedral Tunes –<br><br>

Heavenly Hurt, it gives us –<br>
We can find no scar,<br>
But internal difference,<br>
Where the Meanings, are –<br>

None may teach it – Any –<br>
'Tis the Seal Despair –<br>
An imperial affliction<br>
Sent us of the Air –<br>

When it comes, the Landscape listens –<br>
Shadows – hold their breath –<br>
When it goes, 'tis like the Distance<br>
On the look of Death –</p>
