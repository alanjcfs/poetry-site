<p>I've dropped my Brain — My Soul is numb —<br>
The Veins that used to run<br>
Stop palsied — 'tis Paralysis<br>
Done perfecter on stone<br><br>
Vitality is Carved and cool.<br>
My nerve in Marble lies —<br>
A Breathing Woman<br>
Yesterday — Endowed with Paradise.<br><br>
Not dumb — I had a sort that moved —<br>
A Sense that smote and stirred —<br>
Instincts for Dance — a caper part —<br>
An Aptitude for Bird —<br><br>
Who wrought Carrara in me<br>
And chiselled all my tune<br>
Were it a Witchcraft — were it Death —<br>
I've still a chance to strain<br><br>
To Being, somewhere — Motion — Breath —<br>
Though Centuries beyond,<br>
And every limit a Decade —<br>
I'll shiver, satisfied.</p>
