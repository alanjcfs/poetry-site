<p>Taking up the fair Ideal,<br>
Just to cast her down<br>
When a fracture — we discover —<br>
Or a splintered Crown —<br>
Makes the Heavens portable —<br>
And the Gods — a lie —<br>
Doubtless — "Adam" — scowled at Eden —<br>
For his perjury!<br><br>
Cherishing — our pool Ideal —<br>
Till in purer dress —<br>
We behold her — glorified —<br>
Comforts — search — like this —<br>
Till the broken creatures —<br>
We adored — for whole —<br>
Stains — all washed —<br>
Transfigured — mended —<br>
Meet us — with a smile —</p>
