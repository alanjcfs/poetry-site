<p>A great Hope fell<br>
You heard no noise<br>
The Ruin was within<br>
Oh cunning wreck that told no tale<br>
And let no Witness in<br><br>
The mind was built for mighty Freight<br>
For dread occasion planned<br>
How often foundering at Sea<br>
Ostensibly, on Land<br><br>
A not admitting of the wound<br>
Until it grew so wide<br>
That all my Life had entered it<br>
And there were troughs beside<br><br>
A closing of the simple lid<br>
That opened to the sun<br>
Until the tender Carpenter<br>
Perpetual nail it down â€”</p>
