<p>The Sun kept stooping — stooping — low!<br>
The Hills to meet him rose!<br>
On his side, what Transaction!<br>
On their side, what Repose!<br><br>
Deeper and deeper grew the stain<br>
Upon the window pane —<br>
Thicker and thicker stood the feet<br>
Until the Tyrian<br><br>
Was crowded dense with Armies —<br>
So gay, so Brigadier —<br>
That I felt martial stirrings<br>
Who once the Cockade wore —<br><br>
Charged from my chimney corner —<br>
But Nobody was there!</p>
