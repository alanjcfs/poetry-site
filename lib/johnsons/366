<p>Although I put away his life —<br>
An Ornament too grand<br>
For Forehead low as mine, to wear,<br>
This might have been the Hand<br><br>
That sowed the flower, he preferred —<br>
Or smoothed a homely pain,<br>
Or pushed the pebble from his path —<br>
Or played his chosen tune —<br><br>
On Lute the least — the latest —<br>
But just his Ear could know<br>
That whatsoe'er delighted it,<br>
I never would let go —<br><br>
The foot to bear his errand —<br>
A little Boot I know —<br>
Would leap abroad like Antelope —<br>
With just the grant to do —<br><br>
His weariest Commandment —<br>
A sweeter to obey,<br>
Than "Hide and Seek" —<br>
Or skip to Flutes —<br>
Or all Day, chase the Bee —<br><br>
Your Servant, Sir, will weary —<br>
The Surgeon, will not come —<br>
The World, will have its own — to do —<br>
The Dust, will vex your Fame —<br><br>
The Cold will force your tightest door<br>
Some February Day,<br>
But say my apron bring the sticks<br>
To make your Cottage gay —<br><br>
That I may take that promise<br>
To Paradise, with me —<br>
To teach the Angels, avarice,<br>
You, Sir, taught first — to me.</p>
