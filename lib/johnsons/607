<p>Of nearness to her sundered Things<br>
The Soul has special times —<br>
When Dimness — looks the Oddity —<br>
Distinctness — easy — seems —<br><br>
The Shapes we buried, dwell about,<br>
Familiar, in the Rooms —<br>
Untarnished by the Sepulchre,<br>
The Mouldering Playmate comes —<br><br>
In just the Jacket that he wore —<br>
Long buttoned in the Mold<br>
Since we — old mornings, Children — played —<br>
Divided — by a world —<br><br>
The Grave yields back her Robberies —<br>
The Years, our pilfered Things —<br>
Bright Knots of Apparitions<br>
Salute us, with their wings —<br><br>
As we — it were — that perished —<br>
Themself — had just remained till we rejoin them —<br>
And 'twas they, and not ourself<br>
That mourned.</p>
