<p>The Moon was but a Chin of Gold<br>
A Night or two ago —<br>
And now she turns Her perfect Face<br>
Upon the World below —<br><br>
Her Forehead is of Amplest Blonde —<br>
Her Cheek — a Beryl hewn —<br>
Her Eye unto the Summer Dew<br>
The likest I have known —<br><br>
Her Lips of Amber never part —<br>
But what must be the smile<br>
Upon Her Friend she could confer<br>
Were such Her Silver Will —<br><br>
And what a privilege to be<br>
But the remotest Star —<br>
For Certainty She take Her Way<br>
Beside Your Palace Door —<br><br>
Her Bonnet is the Firmament —<br>
The Universe — Her Shoe —<br>
The Stars — the Trinkets at Her Belt —<br>
Her Dimities — of Blue —</p>
