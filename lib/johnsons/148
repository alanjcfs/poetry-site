<p>All overgrown by cunning moss,<br>
All interspersed with weed,<br>
The little cage of "Currer Bell"<br>
In quiet "Haworth" laid.<br><br>
Gathered from many wanderings —<br>
Gethsemane can tell<br>
Thro' what transporting anguish<br>
She reached the Asphodel!<br><br>
Soft fall the sounds of Eden<br>
Upon her puzzled ear —<br>
Oh what an afternoon for Heaven,<br>
When "Bronte" entered there!</p>
