<p>Like her the Saints retire,<br>
In their Chapeaux of fire,<br>
Martial as she!<br><br>
Like her the Evenings steal<br>
Purple and Cochineal<br>
After the Day!<br><br>
"Departed" — both — they say!<br>
i.e. gathered away,<br>
Not found,<br><br>
Argues the Aster still —<br>
Reasons the Daffodil<br>
Profound!</p>
