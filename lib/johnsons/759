<p>He fought like those Who've nought to lose —<br>
Bestowed Himself to Balls<br>
As One who for a further Life<br>
Had not a further Use —<br><br>
Invited Death — with bold attempt —<br>
But Death was Coy of Him<br>
As Other Men, were Coy of Death —<br>
To Him — to live — was Doom —<br><br>
His Comrades, shifted like the Flakes<br>
When Gusts reverse the Snow —<br>
But He — was left alive Because<br>
Of Greediness to die —</p>
