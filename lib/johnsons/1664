<p>I did not reach Thee<br>
But my feet slip nearer every day<br>
Three Rivers and a Hill to cross<br>
One Desert and a Sea<br>
I shall not count the journey one<br>
When I am telling thee.<br><br>
Two deserts, but the Year is cold<br>
So that will help the sand<br>
One desert crossed —<br>
The second one<br>
Will feel as cool as land<br>
Sahara is too little price<br>
To pay for thy Right hand.<br><br>
The Sea comes last — Step merry, feet,<br>
So short we have to go —<br>
To play together we are prone,<br>
But we must labor now,<br>
The last shall be the lightest load<br>
That we have had to draw.<br><br>
The Sun goes crooked —<br>
That is Night<br>
Before he makes the bend.<br>
We must have passed the Middle Sea —<br>
Almost we wish the End<br>
Were further off —<br>
Too great it seems<br>
So near the Whole to stand.<br><br>
We step like Plush,<br>
We stand like snow,<br>
The waters murmur new.<br>
Three rivers and the Hill are passed —<br>
Two deserts and the sea!<br>
Now Death usurps my Premium<br>
And gets the look at Thee.</p>
