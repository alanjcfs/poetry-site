<p>We dream — it is good we are dreaming —<br>
It would hurt us — were we awake —<br>
But since it is playing — kill us,<br>
And we are playing — shriek —<br><br>
What harm? Men die — externally —<br>
It is a truth — of Blood —<br>
But we — are dying in Drama —<br>
And Drama — is never dead —<br><br>
Cautious — We jar each other —<br>
And either — open the eyes —<br>
Lest the Phantasm — prove the Mistake —<br>
And the livid Surprise<br><br>
Cool us to Shafts of Granite —<br>
With just an Age — and Name —<br>
And perhaps a phrase in Egyptian —<br>
It's prudenter — to dream —</p>
