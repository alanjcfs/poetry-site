<p>I gained it so —<br>
By Climbing slow —<br>
By Catching at the Twigs that grow<br>
Between the Bliss — and me —<br>
It hung so high<br>
As well the Sky<br>
Attempt by Strategy —<br>
<br>
I said I gained it —<br>
This — was all —<br>
Look, how I clutch it<br>
Lest it fall —<br>
And I a Pauper go —<br>
Unfitted by an instant's Grace<br>
For the Contented — Beggar's face<br>
I wore — an hour ago —</p>
