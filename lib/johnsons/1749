<p>The waters chased him as he fled,<br>
Not daring look behind —<br>
A billow whispered in his Ear,<br>
"Come home with me, my friend —<br>
My parlor is of shriven glass,<br>
My pantry has a fish<br>
For every palate in the Year" —<br>
To this revolting bliss<br>
The object floating at his side<br>
Made no distinct reply.</p>
