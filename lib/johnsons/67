<p>Success is counted sweetest<br>
By those who ne'er succeed.<br>
To comprehend a nectar<br>
Requires sorest need.<br><br>

Not one of all the purple host<br>
Who took the flag to-day<br>
Can tell the definition,<br>
So clear, of victory,<br><br>

As he, defeated, dying,<br>
On whose forbidden ear<br>
The distant strains of triumph<br>
Break, agonized and clear.</p>
