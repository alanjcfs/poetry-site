<p>The Martyr Poets — did not tell —<br>
But wrought their Pang in syllable —<br>
That when their mortal name be numb —<br>
Their mortal fate — encourage Some —<br><br>
The Martyr Painters — never spoke —<br>
Bequeathing — rather — to their Work —<br>
That when their conscious fingers cease —<br>
Some seek in Art — the Art of Peace —</p>
