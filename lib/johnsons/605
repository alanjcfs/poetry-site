<p>The Spider holds a Silver Ball<br>
In unperceived Hands —<br>
And dancing softly to Himself<br>
His Yarn of Pearl — unwinds —<br><br>
He plies from Nought to Nought —<br>
In unsubstantial Trade —<br>
Supplants our Tapestries with His —<br>
In half the period —<br><br>
An Hour to rear supreme<br>
His Continents of Light —<br>
Then dangle from the Housewife's Broom —<br>
His Boundaries — forgot —</p>
