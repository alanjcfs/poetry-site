<p>The Doomed — regard the Sunrise<br>
With different Delight —<br>
Because — when next it burns abroad<br>
They doubt to witness it —<br><br>
The Man — to die — tomorrow —<br>
Harks for the Meadow Bird —<br>
Because its Music stirs the Axe<br>
That clamors for his head —<br><br>
Joyful — to whom the Sunrise<br>
Precedes Enamored — Day —<br>
Joyful — for whom the Meadow Bird<br>
Has ought but Elegy!</p>
