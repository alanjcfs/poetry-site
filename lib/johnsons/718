<p>I meant to find Her when I came —<br>
Death — had the same design —<br>
But the Success — was His — it seems —<br>
And the Surrender — Mine —<br><br>
I meant to tell Her how I longed<br>
For just this single time —<br>
But Death had told Her so the first —<br>
And she had past, with Him —<br><br>
To wander — now — is my Repose —<br>
To rest — To rest would be<br>
A privilege of Hurricane<br>
To Memory — and Me.</p>
