<p>Our little Kinsmen â€” after Rain<br>
In plenty may be seen,<br>
A Pink and Pulpy multitude<br>
The tepid Ground upon.<br><br>
A needless life, it seemed to me<br>
Until a little Bird<br>
As to a Hospitality<br>
Advanced and breakfasted.<br><br>
As I of He, so God of Me<br>
I pondered, may have judged,<br>
And left the little Angle Worm<br>
With Modesties enlarged.</p>
