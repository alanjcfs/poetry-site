<p>Who never lost, are unprepared<br>
A Coronet to find!<br>
Who never thirsted<br>
Flagons, and Cooling Tamarind!<br><br>
Who never climbed the weary league —<br>
Can such a foot explore<br>
The purple territories<br>
On Pizarro's shore?<br><br>
How many Legions overcome —<br>
The Emperor will say?<br>
How many Colors taken<br>
On Revolution Day?<br><br>
How many Bullets bearest?<br>
Hast Thou the Royal scar?<br>
Angels! Write "Promoted"<br>
On this Soldier's brow!</p>
