<p>The Truth — is stirless —<br>
Other force — may be presumed to move —<br>
This — then — is best for confidence —<br>
When oldest Cedars swerve —<br><br>
And Oaks untwist their fists —<br>
And Mountains — feeble — lean —<br>
How excellent a Body, that<br>
Stands without a Bone —<br><br>
How vigorous a Force<br>
That holds without a Prop —<br>
Truth stays Herself — and every man<br>
That trusts Her — boldly up —</p>
