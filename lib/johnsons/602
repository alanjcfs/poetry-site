<p>Of Brussels — it was not —<br>
Of Kidderminster? Nay —<br>
The Winds did buy it of the Woods —<br>
They — sold it unto me<br><br>
It was a gentle price —<br>
The poorest — could afford —<br>
It was within the frugal purse<br>
Of Beggar — or of Bird —<br><br>
Of small and spicy Yards —<br>
In hue — a mellow Dun —<br>
Of Sunshine — and of Sere — Composed —<br>
But, principally — of Sun —<br><br>
The Wind — unrolled it fast —<br>
And spread it on the Ground —<br>
Upholsterer of the Pines — is He —<br>
Upholsterer — of the Pond —</p>
