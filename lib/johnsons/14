<p>One Sister have I in our house -<br>
And one, a hedge away.<br>
There's only one recorded,<br>
But both belong to me.<br>
<br>
One came the road that I came -<br>
And wore my last year's gown -<br>
The other, as a bird her nest,<br>
Builded our hearts among.<br>
<br>
She did not sing as we did -<br>
It was a different tune -<br>
Herself to her a music<br>
As Bumble bee of June.<br>
<br>
Today is far from Childhood -<br>
But up and down the hills<br>
I held her hand the tighter -<br>
Which shortened all the miles -<br>
<br>
And still her hum<br>
The year among,<br>
Deceives the Butterfly;<br>
Still in her Eye<br>
The Violets lie<br>
Mouldered this many May.<br>
<br>
I spilt the dew -<br>
But took the morn;<br>
I chose this single star<br>
From out the wide night's numbers -<br>
Sue - forevermore!</p>
