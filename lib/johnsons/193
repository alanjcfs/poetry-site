<p>I shall know why, when time is over,<br>
And I have ceased to wonder why<br>
Christ will explain each separate anguish<br>
In the fair schoolroom of the sky.<br>
<br>
He will tell me what Peter promised,<br>
And I, for wonder at his woe,<br>
I shall forget the drop of anguish<br>
That scalds me now, that scalds me now.</p>
