<p>It makes no difference abroad —<br>
The Seasons — fit — the same —<br>
The Mornings blossom into Noons —<br>
And split their Pods of Flame —<br><br>
Wild flowers — kindle in the Woods —<br>
The Brooks slam — all the Day —<br>
No Black bird bates his Banjo —<br>
For passing Calvary —<br><br>
Auto da Fe — and Judgment —<br>
Are nothing to the Bee —<br>
His separation from His Rose —<br>
To Him — sums Misery —</p>
