<p>It knew no Medicine —<br>
It was not Sickness — then —<br>
Nor any need of Surgery —<br>
And therefore — 'twas not Pain —<br><br>
It moved away the Cheeks —<br>
A Dimple at a time —<br>
And left the Profile — plainer —<br>
And in the place of Bloom<br><br>
It left the little Tint<br>
That never had a Name —<br>
You've seen it on a Cast's face —<br>
Was Paradise — to blame —<br><br>
If momently ajar —<br>
Temerity — drew near —<br>
And sickened — ever afterward<br>
For Somewhat that it saw?</p>
