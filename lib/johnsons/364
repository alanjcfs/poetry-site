<p>The Morning after Woe —<br>
'Tis frequently the Way —<br>
Surpasses all that rose before —<br>
For utter Jubilee —<br><br>
As Nature did not care —<br>
And piled her Blossoms on —<br>
And further to parade a Joy<br>
Her Victim stared upon —<br><br>
The Birds declaim their Tunes —<br>
Pronouncing every word<br>
Like Hammers — Did they know they fell<br>
Like Litanies of Lead —<br><br>
On here and there — a creature —<br>
They'd modify the Glee<br>
To fit some Crucifixal Clef —<br>
Some Key of Calvary —</p>
