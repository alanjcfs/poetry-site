<p>You love me — you are sure —<br>
I shall not fear mistake —<br>
I shall not cheated wake —<br>
Some grinning morn —<br>
To find the Sunrise left —<br>
And Orchards — unbereft —<br>
And Dollie — gone!<br><br>
I need not start — you're sure —<br>
That night will never be —<br>
When frightened — home to Thee I run —<br>
To find the windows dark —<br>
And no more Dollie — mark —<br>
Quite none?<br><br>
Be sure you're sure — you know —<br>
I'll bear it better now —<br>
If you'll just tell me so —<br>
Than when — a little dull Balm grown —<br>
Over this pain of mine —<br>
You sting — again!</p>
