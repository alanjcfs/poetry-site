<p>My Worthiness is all my Doubt —<br>
His Merit — all my fear —<br>
Contrasting which, my quality<br>
Do lowlier — appear —<br><br>
Lest I should insufficient prove<br>
For His beloved Need —<br>
The Chiefest Apprehension<br>
Upon my thronging Mind —<br><br>
'Tis true — that Deity to stoop<br>
Inherently incline —<br>
For nothing higher than Itself<br>
Itself can rest upon —<br><br>
So I — the undivine abode<br>
Of His Elect Content —<br>
Conform my Soul — as 'twere a Church,<br>
Unto Her Sacrament —</p>
