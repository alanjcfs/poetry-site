<p>He preached upon "Breadth" till it argued him narrow —<br>
The Broad are too broad to define<br>
And of "Truth" until it proclaimed him a Liar —<br>
The Truth never flaunted a Sign —<br><br>
Simplicity fled from his counterfeit presence<br>
As Gold the Pyrites would shun —<br>
What confusion would cover the innocent Jesus<br>
To meet so enabled a Man!</p>
