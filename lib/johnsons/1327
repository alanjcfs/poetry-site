<p>The Symptom of the Gale —<br>
The Second of Dismay —<br>
Between its Rumor and its Face —<br>
Is almost Revelry —<br><br>
The Houses firmer root —<br>
The Heavens cannot be found —<br>
The Upper Surfaces of things<br>
Take covert in the Ground —<br><br>
The Mem'ry of the Sun<br>
Not Any can recall —<br>
Although by Nature's sterling Watch<br>
So scant an interval —<br><br>
And when the Noise is caught<br>
And Nature looks around —<br>
"We dreamed it"? She interrogates —<br>
"Good Morning" — We propound?</p>
