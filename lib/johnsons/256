<p>If I'm lost — now<br>
That I was found —<br>
Shall still my transport be —<br>
That once — on me — those Jasper Gates<br>
Blazed open — suddenly —<br><br>
That in my awkward — gazing — face —<br>
The Angels — softly peered —<br>
And touched me with their fleeces,<br>
Almost as if they cared —<br>
I'm banished — now — you know it —<br>
How foreign that can be —<br>
You'll know — Sir — when the Savior's face<br>
Turns so — away from you —</p>
