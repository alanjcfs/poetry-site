<p>One Blessing had I than the rest<br>
So larger to my Eyes<br>
That I stopped gauging — satisfied —<br>
For this enchanted size —<br><br>
It was the limit of my Dream —<br>
The focus of my Prayer —<br>
A perfect — paralyzing Bliss —<br>
Contented as Despair —<br><br>
I knew no more of Want — or Cold —<br>
Phantasms both become<br>
For this new Value in the Soul —<br>
Supremest Earthly Sum —<br><br>
The Heaven below the Heaven above —<br>
Obscured with ruddier Blue —<br>
Life's Latitudes leant over — full —<br>
The Judgment perished — too —<br><br>
Why Bliss so scantily disburse —<br>
Why Paradise defer —<br>
Why Floods be served to Us — in Bowls —<br>
I speculate no more —</p>
