<p>The Bible is an antique Volume —<br>
Written by faded men<br>
At the suggestion of Holy Spectres —<br>
Subjects — Bethlehem —<br>
Eden — the ancient Homestead —<br>
Satan — the Brigadier —<br>
Judas — the Great Defaulter —<br>
David — the Troubador —<br>
Sin — a distinguished Precipice<br>
Others must resist —<br>
Boys that "believe" are very lonesome —<br>
Other Boys are "lost" —<br>
Had but the Tale a warbling Teller —<br>
All the Boys would come —<br>
Orpheus' Sermon captivated —<br>
It did not condemn —</p>
