<p>The Gentian weaves her fringes —<br>
The Maple's loom is red —<br>
My departing blossoms<br>
Obviate parade.<br><br>
A brief, but patient illness —<br>
An hour to prepare,<br>
And one below this morning<br>
Is where the angels are —<br>
It was a short procession,<br>
The Bobolink was there —<br>
An aged Bee addressed us —<br>
And then we knelt in prayer —<br>
We trust that she was willing —<br>
We ask that we may be.<br>
Summer — Sister — Seraph!<br>
Let us go with thee!<br><br>
In the name of the Bee —<br>
And of the Butterfly —<br>
And of the Breeze — Amen!</p>
