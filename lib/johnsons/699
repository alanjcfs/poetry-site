<p>The Judge is like the Owl —<br>
I've heard my Father tell —<br>
And Owls do build in Oaks —<br>
So here's an Amber Sill —<br><br>
That slanted in my Path —<br>
When going to the Barn —<br>
And if it serve You for a House —<br>
Itself is not in vain —<br><br>
About the price — 'tis small —<br>
I only ask a Tune<br>
At Midnight — Let the Owl select<br>
His favorite Refrain.</p>
