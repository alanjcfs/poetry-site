<p>Love — thou art high —<br>
I cannot climb thee —<br>
But, were it Two —<br>
Who knows but we —<br>
Taking turns — at the Chimborazo —<br>
Ducal — at last — stand up by thee —<br>
<br>
Love — thou are deep —<br>
I cannot cross thee —<br>
But, were there Two<br>
Instead of One —<br>
Rower, and Yacht — some sovereign Summer —<br>
Who knows — but we'd reach the Sun?<br>
<br>
Love — thou are Veiled —<br>
A few — behold thee —<br>
Smile — and alter — and prattle — and die —<br>
Bliss — were an Oddity — without thee —<br>
Nicknamed by God —<br>
Eternity —</p>
