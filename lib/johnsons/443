<p>I tie my Hat — I crease my Shawl —<br>
Life's little duties do — precisely —<br>
As the very least<br>
Were infinite — to me —<br>
<br>
I put new Blossoms in the Glass —<br>
And throw the old — away —<br>
I push a petal from my Gown<br>
That anchored there — I weigh<br>
The time 'twill be till six o'clock<br>
I have so much to do —<br>
And yet — Existence — some way back —<br>
Stopped — struck — my ticking — through —<br>
We cannot put Ourself away<br>
As a completed Man<br>
Or Woman — When the Errand's done<br>
We came to Flesh — upon —<br>
There may be — Miles on Miles of Nought —<br>
Of Action — sicker far —<br>
To simulate — is stinging work —<br>
To cover what we are<br>
From Science — and from Surgery —<br>
Too Telescopic Eyes<br>
To bear on us unshaded —<br>
For their — sake — not for Ours —<br>
'Twould start them —<br>
We — could tremble —<br>
But since we got a Bomb —<br>
And held it in our Bosom —<br>
Nay — Hold it — it is calm —<br>
<br>
Therefore — we do life's labor —<br>
Though life's Reward — be done —<br>
With scrupulous exactness —<br>
To hold our Senses — on —</p>
