<p>Under the Light, yet under,<br>
Under the Grass and the Dirt,<br>
Under the Beetle's Cellar<br>
Under the Clover's Root,<br><br>
Further than Arm could stretch<br>
Were it Giant long,<br>
Further than Sunshine could<br>
Were the Day Year long,<br><br>
Over the Light, yet over,<br>
Over the Arc of the Bird —<br>
Over the Comet's chimney —<br>
Over the Cubit's Head,<br><br>
Further than Guess can gallop<br>
Further than Riddle ride —<br>
Oh for a Disc to the Distance<br>
Between Ourselves and the Dead!</p>
