<p>I went to thank her,<br>
But she slept<br>
Her bed a funnelled stone,<br>
With nosegays at the head and foot,<br>
That travellers had thrown,<br>
<br>
Who went to thank her<br>
But she slept.<br>
'T was short to cross the sea<br>
To look upon her like, alive,<br>
But turning back 't was slow.</p>
