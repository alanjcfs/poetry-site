<p>If your Nerve, deny you —<br>
Go above your Nerve —<br>
He can lean against the Grave,<br>
If he fear to swerve —<br>
<br>
That's a steady posture —<br>
Never any bend<br>
Held of those Brass arms —<br>
Best Giant made —<br>
<br>
If your Soul seesaw —<br>
Lift the Flesh door —<br>
The Poltroon wants Oxygen —<br>
Nothing more —</p>
