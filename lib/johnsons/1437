<p>A Dew sufficed itself —<br>
And satisfied a Leaf<br>
And felt "how vast a destiny" —<br>
"How trivial is Life!"<br><br>
The Sun went out to work —<br>
The Day went out to play<br>
And not again that Dew be seen<br>
By Physiognomy<br><br>
Whether by Day Abducted<br>
Or emptied by the Sun<br>
Into the Sea in passing<br>
Eternally unknown<br><br>
Attested to this Day<br>
That awful Tragedy<br>
By Transport's instability<br>
And Doom's celerity.</p>
