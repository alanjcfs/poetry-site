<p>There is a flower that Bees prefer —<br>
And Butterflies — desire —<br>
To gain the Purple Democrat<br>
The Humming Bird — aspire —<br><br>
And Whatsoever Insect pass —<br>
A Honey bear away<br>
Proportioned to his several dearth<br>
And her — capacity —<br><br>
Her face be rounder than the Moon<br>
And ruddier than the Gown<br>
Or Orchis in the Pasture —<br>
Or Rhododendron — worn —<br><br>
She doth not wait for June —<br>
Before the World be Green —<br>
Her sturdy little Countenance<br>
Against the Wind — be seen —<br><br>
Contending with the Grass —<br>
Near Kinsman to Herself —<br>
For Privilege of Sod and Sun —<br>
Sweet Litigants for Life —<br><br>
And when the Hills be full —<br>
And newer fashions blow —<br>
Doth not retract a single spice<br>
For pang of jealousy —<br><br>
Her Public — be the Noon —<br>
Her Providence — the Sun —<br>
Her Progress — by the Bee — proclaimed —<br>
In sovereign — Swerveless Tune —<br><br>
The Bravest — of the Host —<br>
Surrendering — the last —<br>
Nor even of Defeat — aware —<br>
What cancelled by the Frost —</p>
