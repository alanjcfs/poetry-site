<p>Whose are the little beds, I asked<br>
Which in the valleys lie?<br>
Some shook their heads, and others smiled —<br>
And no one made reply.<br><br>
Perhaps they did not hear, I said,<br>
I will inquire again —<br>
Whose are the beds — the tiny beds<br>
So thick upon the plain?<br><br>
'Tis Daisy, in the shortest —<br>
A little further on —<br>
Nearest the door — to wake the Ist —<br>
Little Leontoden.<br><br>
'Tis Iris, Sir, and Aster —<br>
Anemone, and Bell —<br>
Bartsia, in the blanket red —<br>
And chubby Daffodil.<br><br>
Meanwhile, at many cradles<br>
Her busy foot she plied —<br>
Humming the quaintest lullaby<br>
That ever rocked a child.<br><br>
Hush! Epigea wakens!<br>
The Crocus stirs her lids —<br>
Rhodora's cheek is crimson,<br>
She's dreaming of the woods!<br><br>
Then turning from them reverent —<br>
Their bedtime 'tis, she said —<br>
The Bumble bees will wake them<br>
When April woods are red.</p>
