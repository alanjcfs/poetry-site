<p>Not probable — The barest Chance —<br>
A smile too few — a word too much<br>
And far from Heaven as the Rest —<br>
The Soul so close on Paradise —<br>
<br>
What if the Bird from journey far —<br>
Confused by Sweets — as Mortals — are —<br>
Forget the secret of His wing<br>
And perish — but a Bough between —<br>
Oh, Groping feet —<br>
Oh Phantom Queen!</p>
