<p>Went up a year this evening!<br>
I recollect it well!<br>
Amid no bells nor bravoes<br>
The bystanders will tell!<br>
Cheerful — as to the village —<br>
Tranquil — as to repose —<br>
Chastened — as to the Chapel<br>
This humble Tourist rose!<br>
Did not talk of returning!<br>
Alluded to no time<br>
When, were the gales propitious —<br>
We might look for him!<br>
Was grateful for the Roses<br>
In life's diverse bouquet —<br>
Talked softly of new species<br>
To pick another day;<br>
Beguiling thus the wonder<br>
The wondrous nearer drew —<br>
Hands bustled at the moorings —<br>
The crown respectful grew —<br>
Ascended from our vision<br>
To Countenances new!<br>
A Difference — A Daisy —<br>
Is all the rest I knew!</p>
