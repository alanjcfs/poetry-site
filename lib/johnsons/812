<p>A Light exists in Spring<br>
Not present on the Year<br>
At any other period —<br>
When March is scarcely here<br><br>
A Color stands abroad<br>
On Solitary Fields<br>
That Science cannot overtake<br>
But Human Nature feels.<br><br>
It waits upon the Lawn,<br>
It shows the furthest Tree<br>
Upon the furthest Slope you know<br>
It almost speaks to you.<br><br>
Then as Horizons step<br>
Or Noons report away<br>
Without the Formula of sound<br>
It passes and we stay —<br><br>
A quality of loss<br>
Affecting our Content<br>
As Trade had suddenly encroached<br>
Upon a Sacrament.</p>
