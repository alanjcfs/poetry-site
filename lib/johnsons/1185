<p>A little Dog that wags his tail<br>
And knows no other joy<br>
Of such a little Dog am I<br>
Reminded by a Boy<br><br>
Who gambols all the living Day<br>
Without an earthly cause<br>
Because he is a little Boy<br>
I honestly suppose —<br><br>
The Cat that in the Corner dwells<br>
Her martial Day forgot<br>
The Mouse but a Tradition now<br>
Of her desireless Lot<br><br>
Another class remind me<br>
Who neither please nor play<br>
But not to make a "bit of noise"<br>
Beseech each little Boy —</p>
