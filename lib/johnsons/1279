<p>The Way to know the Bobolink<br>
From every other Bird<br>
Precisely as the Joy of him —<br>
Obliged to be inferred.<br><br>
Of impudent Habiliment<br>
Attired to defy,<br>
Impertinence subordinate<br>
At times to Majesty.<br><br>
Of Sentiments seditious<br>
Amenable to Law —<br>
As Heresies of Transport<br>
Or Puck's Apostacy.<br><br>
Extrinsic to Attention<br>
Too intimate with Joy —<br>
He compliments existence<br>
Until allured away<br><br>
By Seasons or his Children —<br>
Adult and urgent grown —<br>
Or unforeseen aggrandizement<br>
Or, happily, Renown —<br><br>
By Contrast certifying<br>
The Bird of Birds is gone —<br>
How nullified the Meadow —<br>
Her Sorcerer withdrawn!</p>
