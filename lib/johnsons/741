<p>Drama's Vitallest Expression is the Common Day<br>
That arise and set about Us —<br>
Other Tragedy<br>
<br>
Perish in the Recitation —<br>
This — the best enact<br>
When the Audience is scattered<br>
And the Boxes shut —<br>
<br>
"Hamlet" to Himself were Hamlet —<br>
Had not Shakespeare wrote —<br>
Though the "Romeo" left no Record<br>
Of his Juliet,<br>
<br>
It were infinite enacted<br>
In the Human Heart —<br>
Only Theatre recorded<br>
Owner cannot shut —</p>
