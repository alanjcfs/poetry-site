<p>As far from pity, as complaint —<br>
As cool to speech — as stone —<br>
As numb to Revelation<br>
As if my Trade were Bone —<br><br>
As far from time — as History —<br>
As near yourself — Today —<br>
As Children, to the Rainbow's scarf —<br>
Or Sunset's Yellow play<br><br>
To eyelids in the Sepulchre —<br>
How dumb the Dancer lies —<br>
While Color's Revelations break —<br>
And blaze — the Butterflies!</p>
