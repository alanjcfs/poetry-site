<p>All forgot for recollecting<br>
Just a paltry One —<br>
All forsook, for just a Stranger's<br>
New Accompanying —<br><br>
Grace of Wealth, and Grace of Station<br>
Less accounted than<br>
An unknown Esteem possessing —<br>
Estimate — Who can —<br><br>
Home effaced — Her faces dwindled —<br>
Nature — altered small —<br>
Sun — if shone — or Storm — if shattered —<br>
Overlooked I all —<br><br>
Dropped — my fate — a timid Pebble —<br>
In thy bolder Sea —<br>
Prove — me — Sweet — if I regret it —<br>
Prove Myself — of Thee —</p>
