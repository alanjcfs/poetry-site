<p>Risk is the Hair that holds the Tun<br>
Seductive in the Air —<br>
That Tun is hollow — but the Tun —<br>
With Hundred Weights — to spare —<br><br>
Too ponderous to suspect the snare<br>
Espies that fickle chair<br>
And seats itself to be let go<br>
By that perfidious Hair —<br><br>
The "foolish Tun" the Critics say —<br>
While that delusive Hair<br>
Persuasive as Perdition,<br>
Decoys its Traveller.</p>
