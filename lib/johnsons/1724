<p>How dare the robins sing,<br>
When men and women hear<br>
Who since they went to their account<br>
Have settled with the year! â€”<br>
Paid all that life had earned<br>
In one consummate bill,<br>
And now, what life or death can do<br>
Is immaterial.<br>
Insulting is the sun<br>
To him whose mortal light<br>
Beguiled of immortality<br>
Bequeaths him to the night.<br>
Extinct be every hum<br>
In deference to him<br>
Whose garden wrestles with the dew,<br>
At daybreak overcome!</p>
