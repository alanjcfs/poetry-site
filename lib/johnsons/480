<p>"Why do I love" You, Sir?<br>
Because —<br>
The Wind does not require the Grass<br>
To answer — Wherefore when He pass<br>
She cannot keep Her place.<br><br>
Because He knows — and<br>
Do not You —<br>
And We know not —<br>
Enough for Us<br>
The Wisdom it be so —<br><br>
The Lightning — never asked an Eye<br>
Wherefore it shut — when He was by —<br>
Because He knows it cannot speak —<br>
And reasons not contained —<br>
— Of Talk —<br>
There be — preferred by Daintier Folk —<br><br>
The Sunrise — Sire — compelleth Me —<br>
Because He's Sunrise — and I see —<br>
Therefore — Then —<br>
I love Thee —</p>
