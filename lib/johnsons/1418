<p>How lonesome the Wind must feel Nights —<br>
When people have put out the Lights<br>
And everything that has an Inn<br>
Closes the shutter and goes in —<br><br>
How pompous the Wind must feel Noons<br>
Stepping to incorporeal Tunes<br>
Correcting errors of the sky<br>
And clarifying scenery<br><br>
How mighty the Wind must feel Morns<br>
Encamping on a thousand dawns<br>
Espousing each and spurning all<br>
Then soaring to his Temple Tall —</p>
