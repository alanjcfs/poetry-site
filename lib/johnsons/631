<p>Ourselves were wed one summer — dear —<br>
Your Vision — was in June —<br>
And when Your little Lifetime failed,<br>
I wearied — too — of mine —<br><br>
And overtaken in the Dark —<br>
Where You had put me down —<br>
By Some one carrying a Light —<br>
I — too — received the Sign.<br><br>
'Tis true — Our Futures different lay —<br>
Your Cottage — faced the sun —<br>
While Oceans — and the North must be —<br>
On every side of mine<br><br>
'Tis true, Your Garden led the Bloom,<br>
For mine — in Frosts — was sown —<br>
And yet, one Summer, we were Queens —<br>
But You — were crowned in June —</p>
