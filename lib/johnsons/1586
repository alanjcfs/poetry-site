<p>To her derided Home<br>
A Weed of Summer came —<br>
She did not know her station low<br>
Nor Ignominy's Name —<br>
Bestowed a summer long<br>
Upon a frameless flower —<br>
Then swept as lightly from disdain<br>
As Lady from her Bower —<br><br>
Of Bliss the Codes are few —<br>
As Jesus cites of Him —<br>
"Come unto me" the moiety<br>
That wafts the Seraphim —</p>
