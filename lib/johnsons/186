<p>What shall I do — it whimpers so —<br>
This little Hound within the Heart<br>
All day and night with bark and start —<br>
And yet, it will not go —<br>
Would you untie it, were you me —<br>
Would it stop whining — if to Thee —<br>
I sent it — even now?<br><br>
It should not tease you —<br>
By your chair — or, on the mat —<br>
Or if it dare — to climb your dizzy knee —<br>
Or — sometimes at your side to run —<br>
When you were willing —<br>
Shall it come?<br>
Tell Carlo —<br>
He'll tell me!</p>
