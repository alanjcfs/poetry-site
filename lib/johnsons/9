<p>Thro' lane it lay - thro' bramble -<br>
Thro' clearing, and thro' wood -<br>
Banditti often passed us<br>
Opon the lonely road -<br>
The wolf came peering curious -<br>
The Owl looked puzzled down -<br>
The Serpent's satin figure<br>
Glid stealthily along -<br>
The tempests touched our garments -<br>
The lightning's poinards gleamed -<br>
Fierce from the crag above us<br>
The hungry vulture screamed -<br>
The satyr's fingers beckoned -<br>
The Valley murmured "Come" -<br>
These were the mates -<br>
This was the road<br>
These Children fluttered home.</p>

<p>Through lane it lay — through bramble —<br>
Through clearing and through wood —<br>
Banditti often passed us<br>
Upon the lonely road.<br><br>
The wolf came peering curious —<br>
The owl looked puzzled down —<br>
The serpent's satin figure<br>
Glid stealthily along —<br><br>
The tempests touched our garments —<br>
The lightning's poinards gleamed —<br>
Fierce from the Crag above us<br>
The hungry Vulture screamed —<br><br>
The satyr's fingers beckoned —<br>
The valley murmured "Come" —<br>
These were the mates —<br>
This was the road<br>
Those children fluttered home.</p>
