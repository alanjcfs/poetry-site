<p>A Mien to move a Queen —<br>
Half Child — Half Heroine —<br>
An Orleans in the Eye<br>
That puts its manner by<br>
For humbler Company<br>
When none are near<br>
Even a Tear —<br>
Its frequent Visitor —<br><br>
A Bonnet like a Duke —<br>
And yet a Wren's Peruke<br>
Were not so shy<br>
Of Goer by —<br>
And Hands — so slight —<br>
They would elate a Sprite<br>
With Merriment —<br><br>
A Voice that Alters — Low<br>
And on the Ear can go<br>
Like Let of Snow —<br>
Or shift supreme —<br>
As tone of Realm<br>
On Subjects Diadem —<br><br>
Too small — to fear —<br>
Too distant — to endear —<br>
And so Men Compromise<br>
And just — revere —</p>
