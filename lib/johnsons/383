<p>Exhilaration — is within —<br>
There can no Outer Wine<br>
So royally intoxicate<br>
As that diviner Brand<br>
<br>
The Soul achieves — Herself —<br>
To drink — or set away<br>
For Visitor — Or Sacrament —<br>
'Tis not of Holiday<br>
<br>
To stimulate a Man<br>
Who hath the Ample Rhine<br>
Within his Closet — Best you can<br>
Exhale in offering.</p>
