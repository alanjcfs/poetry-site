<p>A Dying Tiger — moaned for Drink —<br>
I hunted all the Sand —<br>
I caught the Dripping of a Rock<br>
And bore it in my Hand —<br><br>
His Mighty Balls — in death were thick —<br>
But searching — I could see<br>
A Vision on the Retina<br>
Of Water — and of me —<br><br>
'Twas not my blame — who sped too slow —<br>
'Twas not his blame — who died<br>
While I was reaching him —<br>
But 'twas — the fact that He was dead —</p>
