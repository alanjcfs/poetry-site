<p>Of Death I try to think like this —<br>
The Well in which they lay us<br>
Is but the Likeness of the Brook<br>
That menaced not to slay us,<br>
But to invite by that Dismay<br>
Which is the Zest of sweetness<br>
To the same Flower Hesperian,<br>
Decoying but to greet us —<br><br>
I do remember when a Child<br>
With bolder Playmates straying<br>
To where a Brook that seemed a Sea<br>
Withheld us by its roaring<br>
From just the Purple Flower beyond<br>
Until constrained to clutch it<br>
If Doom itself were the result,<br>
The boldest leaped, and clutched it —</p>
