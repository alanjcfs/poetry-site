<p>Some we see no more, Tenements of Wonder<br>
Occupy to us though perhaps to them<br>
Simpler are the Days than the Supposition<br>
Leave us to presume<br><br>
That oblique Belief which we call Conjecture<br>
Grapples with a Theme stubborn as Sublime<br>
Able as the Dust to equip its feature<br>
Adequate as Drums<br>
To enlist the Tomb.</p>
