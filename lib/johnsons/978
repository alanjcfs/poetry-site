<p>It bloomed and dropt, a Single Noon —<br>
The Flower — distinct and Red —<br>
I, passing, thought another Noon<br>
Another in its stead<br><br>
Will equal glow, and thought no More<br>
But came another Day<br>
To find the Species disappeared —<br>
The Same Locality —<br><br>
The Sun in place — no other fraud<br>
On Nature's perfect Sum —<br>
Had I but lingered Yesterday —<br>
Was my retrieveless blame —<br><br>
Much Flowers of this and further Zones<br>
Have perished in my Hands<br>
For seeking its Resemblance —<br>
But unapproached it stands —<br><br>
The single Flower of the Earth<br>
That I, in passing by<br>
Unconscious was — Great Nature's Face<br>
Passed infinite by Me —</p>
