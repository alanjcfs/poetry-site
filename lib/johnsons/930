<p>There is a June when Corn is cut<br>
And Roses in the Seed —<br>
A Summer briefer than the first<br>
But tenderer indeed<br><br>
As should a Face supposed the Grave's<br>
Emerge a single Noon<br>
In the Vermilion that it wore<br>
Affect us, and return —<br><br>
Two Seasons, it is said, exist —<br>
The Summer of the Just,<br>
And this of Ours, diversified<br>
With Prospect, and with Frost —<br><br>
May not our Second with its First<br>
So infinite compare<br>
That We but recollect the one<br>
The other to prefer?</p>
