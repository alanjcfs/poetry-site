<p>Like Brooms of Steel<br>
The Snow and Wind<br>
Had swept the Winter Street —<br>
The House was hooked<br>
The Sun sent out<br>
Faint Deputies of Heat —<br>
Where rode the Bird<br>
The Silence tied<br>
His ample — plodding Steed<br>
The Apple in the Cellar snug<br>
Was all the one that played.</p>
