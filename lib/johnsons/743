<p>The Birds reported from the South —<br>
A News express to Me —<br>
A spicy Charge, My little Posts —<br>
But I am deaf — Today —<br><br>
The Flowers — appealed — a timid Throng —<br>
I reinforced the Door —<br>
Go blossom for the Bees — I said —<br>
And trouble Me — no More —<br><br>
The Summer Grace, for Notice strove —<br>
Remote — Her best Array —<br>
The Heart — to stimulate the Eye<br>
Refused too utterly —<br><br>
At length, a Mourner, like Myself,<br>
She drew away austere —<br>
Her frosts to ponder — then it was<br>
I recollected Her —<br><br>
She suffered Me, for I had mourned —<br>
I offered Her no word —<br>
My Witness — was the Crape I bore —<br>
Her — Witness — was Her Dead —<br><br>
Thenceforward — We — together dwelt —<br>
I never questioned Her —<br>
Our Contract<br>
A Wiser Sympathy</p>
