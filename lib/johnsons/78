<p>A poor — torn heart — a tattered heart —<br>
That sat it down to rest —<br>
Nor noticed that the Ebbing Day<br>
Flowed silver to the West —<br>
Nor noticed Night did soft descend —<br>
Nor Constellation burn —<br>
Intent upon the vision<br>
Of latitudes unknown.<br><br>
The angels — happening that way<br>
This dusty heart espied —<br>
Tenderly took it up from toil<br>
And carried it to God —<br>
There — sandals for the Barefoot —<br>
There — gathered from the gales —<br>
Do the blue havens by the hand<br>
Lead the wandering Sails.</p>
