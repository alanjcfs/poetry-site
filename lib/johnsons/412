<p>I read my sentence — steadily —<br>
Reviewed it with my eyes,<br>
To see that I made no mistake<br>
In its extremest clause —<br>
The Date, and manner, of the shame —<br>
And then the Pious Form<br>
That "God have mercy" on the Soul<br>
The Jury voted Him —<br>
I made my soul familiar — with her extremity —<br>
That at the last, it should not be a novel Agony —<br>
But she, and Death, acquainted —<br>
Meet tranquilly, as friends —<br>
Salute, and pass, without a Hint —<br>
And there, the Matter ends —</p>
