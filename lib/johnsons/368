<p>How sick — to wait — in any place — but thine —<br>
I knew last night — when someone tried to twine —<br>
Thinking — perhaps — that I looked tired — or alone —<br>
Or breaking — almost — with unspoken pain —<br>
<br>
And I turned — ducal —<br>
That right — was thine —<br>
One port — suffices — for a Brig — like mine —<br>
<br>
Ours be the tossing — wild though the sea —<br>
Rather than a Mooring — unshared by thee.<br>
Ours be the Cargo — unladed — here —<br>
Rather than the "spicy isles —"<br>
And thou — not there —</p>
