<p>God is a distant — stately Lover —<br>
Woos, as He states us — by His Son —<br>
Verily, a Vicarious Courtship —<br>
"Miles", and "Priscilla", were such an One —<br>
<br>
But, lest the Soul — like fair "Priscilla"<br>
Choose the Envoy — and spurn the Groom —<br>
Vouches, with hyperbolic archness —<br>
"Miles", and "John Alden" were Synonym —</p>
