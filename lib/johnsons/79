<p>Going to Heaven!<br>
I don't know when —<br>
Pray do not ask me how!<br>
Indeed I'm too astonished<br>
To think of answering you!<br>
Going to Heaven!<br>
How dim it sounds!<br>
And yet it will be done<br>
As sure as flocks go home at night<br>
Unto the Shepherd's arm!<br><br>
Perhaps you're going too!<br>
Who knows?<br>
If you should get there first<br>
Save just a little space for me<br>
Close to the two I lost —<br>
The smallest "Robe" will fit me<br>
And just a bit of "Crown" —<br>
For you know we do not mind our dress<br>
When we are going home —<br><br>
I'm glad I don't believe it<br>
For it would stop my breath —<br>
And I'd like to look a little more<br>
At such a curious Earth!<br>
I'm glad they did believe it<br>
Whom I have never found<br>
Since the might Autumn afternoon<br>
I left them in the ground.</p>
