<p>Nobody knows this little rose;<br>
It might a pilgrim be,<br>
Did I not take it from the ways,<br>
And lift it up to thee!<br>
<br>
Only a bee will miss it;<br>
Only a butterfly,<br>
Hastening from far journey,<br>
On it's breast to lie.<br>
<br>
Only a bird will wonder;<br>
Only a breeze will sigh;<br>
Ah! little rose, how easy<br>
For such as thee to die!</p>
