<p>'Twas like a Maelstrom, with a notch,<br>
That nearer, every Day,<br>
Kept narrowing its boiling Wheel<br>
Until the Agony<br><br>
Toyed coolly with the final inch<br>
Of your delirious Hem —<br>
And you dropt, lost,<br>
When something broke —<br>
And let you from a Dream —<br><br>
As if a Goblin with a Gauge —<br>
Kept measuring the Hours —<br>
Until you felt your Second<br>
Weigh, helpless, in his Paws —<br><br>
And not a Sinew — stirred — could help,<br>
And sense was setting numb —<br>
When God — remembered — and the Fiend<br>
Let go, then, Overcome —<br><br>
As if your Sentence stood — pronounced —<br>
And you were frozen led<br>
From Dungeon's luxury of Doubt<br>
To Gibbets, and the Dead —<br><br>
And when the Film had stitched your eyes<br>
A Creature gasped "Reprieve"!<br>
Which Anguish was the utterest — then —<br>
To perish, or to live?</p>
