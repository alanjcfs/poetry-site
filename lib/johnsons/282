<p>How noteless Men, and Pleiads, stand,<br>
Until a sudden sky<br>
Reveals the fact that One is rapt<br>
Forever from the Eye —<br><br>
Members of the Invisible,<br>
Existing, while we stare,<br>
In Leagueless Opportunity,<br>
O'ertakenless, as the Air —<br><br>
Why didn't we detain Them?<br>
The Heavens with a smile,<br>
Sweep by our disappointed Heads<br>
Without a syllable —</p>
