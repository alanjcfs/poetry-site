<p>The Black Berry — wears a Thorn in his side —<br>
But no Man heard Him cry —<br>
He offers His Berry, just the same<br>
To Partridge — and to Boy —<br><br>
He sometimes holds upon the Fence —<br>
Or struggles to a Tree —<br>
Or clasps a Rock, with both His Hands —<br>
But not for Sympathy —<br><br>
We — tell a Hurt — to cool it —<br>
This Mourner — to the Sky<br>
A little further reaches — instead —<br>
Brave Black Berry —</p>
