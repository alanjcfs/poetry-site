<p>Till Death — is narrow Loving —<br>
The scantest Heart extant<br>
Will hold you till your privilege<br>
Of Finiteness — be spent —<br><br>
But He whose loss procures you<br>
Such Destitution that<br>
Your Life too abject for itself<br>
Thenceforward imitate —<br><br>
Until — Resemblance perfect —<br>
Yourself, for His pursuit<br>
Delight of Nature — abdicate —<br>
Exhibit Love — somewhat —</p>
