<p>The Heart has narrow Banks<br>
It measures like the Sea<br>
In mighty — unremitting Bass<br>
And Blue Monotony<br><br>
Till Hurricane bisect<br>
And as itself discerns<br>
Its insufficient Area<br>
The Heart convulsive learns<br><br>
That Calm is but a Wall<br>
Of unattempted Gauze<br>
An instant's Push demolishes<br>
A Questioning — dissolves.</p>
