<p>The Crickets sang<br>
And set the Sun<br>
And Workmen finished one by one<br>
Their Seam the Day upon.<br><br>
The low Grass loaded with the Dew<br>
The Twilight stood, as Strangers do<br>
With Hat in Hand, polite and new<br>
To stay as if, or go.<br><br>
A Vastness, as a Neighbor, came,<br>
A Wisdom, without Face, or Name,<br>
A Peace, as Hemispheres at Home<br>
And so the Night became.</p>
