<p>Afraid! Of whom am I afraid?<br>
Not Death — for who is He?<br>
The Porter of my Father's Lodge<br>
As much abasheth me!<br><br>
Of Life? 'Twere odd I fear [a] thing<br>
That comprehendeth me<br>
In one or two existences —<br>
As Deity decree —<br><br>
Of Resurrection? Is the East<br>
Afraid to trust the Morn<br>
With her fastidious forehead?<br>
As soon impeach my Crown!</p>
