<p>Come show thy Durham Breast<br>
To her who loves thee best,<br>
Delicious Robin —<br>
And if it be not me<br>
At least within my Tree<br>
Do the avowing —<br>
Thy Nuptial so minute<br>
Perhaps is more astute<br>
Than vaster suing —<br>
For so to soar away<br>
Is our propensity<br>
The Day ensuing —</p>
