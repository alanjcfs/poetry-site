<p>Tell as a Marksman — were forgotten<br>
Tell — this Day endures<br>
Ruddy as that coeval Apple<br>
The Tradition bears —<br><br>
Fresh as Mankind that humble story<br>
Though a statelier Tale<br>
Grown in the Repetition hoary<br>
Scarcely would prevail —<br><br>
Tell had a son — The ones that knew it<br>
Need not linger here —<br>
Those who did not to Human Nature<br>
Will subscribe a Tear —<br><br>
Tell would not bare his Head<br>
In Presence<br>
Of the Ducal Hat —<br>
Threatened for that with Death — by Gessler —<br>
Tyranny bethought<br><br>
Make of his only Boy a Target<br>
That surpasses Death —<br>
Stolid to Love's supreme entreaty<br>
Not forsook of Faith —<br><br>
Mercy of the Almighty begging —<br>
Tell his Arrow sent —<br>
God it is said replies in Person<br>
When the cry is meant —</p>
