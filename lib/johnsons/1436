<p>Than Heaven more remote,<br>
For Heaven is the root,<br>
But these the flitted seed.<br>
More flown indeed<br>
Than ones that never were,<br>
Or those that hide, and are.<br><br>
What madness, by their side,<br>
A vision to provide<br>
Of future days<br>
They cannot praise.<br><br>
My soul, to find them, come,<br>
They cannot call, they're dumb,<br>
Nor prove, nor woo,<br>
But that they have abode<br>
Is absolute as God,<br>
And instant, too.</p>
