<p>What mystery pervades a well!<br>
That water lives so far —<br>
A neighbor from another world<br>
Residing in a jar<br><br>
Whose limit none have ever seen,<br>
But just his lid of glass —<br>
Like looking every time you please<br>
In an abyss's face!<br><br>
The grass does not appear afraid,<br>
I often wonder he<br>
Can stand so close and look so bold<br>
At what is awe to me.<br><br>
Related somehow they may be,<br>
The sedge stands next the sea —<br>
Where he is floorless<br>
And does no timidity betray<br><br>
But nature is a stranger yet;<br>
The ones that cite her most<br>
Have never passed her haunted house,<br>
Nor simplified her ghost.<br><br>
To pity those that know her not<br>
Is helped by the regret<br>
That those who know her, know her less<br>
The nearer her they get.</p>
