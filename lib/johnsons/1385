<p>"Secrets" is a daily word<br>
Yet does not exist —<br>
Muffled — it remits surmise —<br>
Murmured — it has ceased —<br>
Dungeoned in the Human Breast<br>
Doubtless secrets lie —<br>
But that Grate inviolate —<br>
Goes nor comes away<br>
Nothing with a Tongue or Ear —<br>
Secrets stapled there<br>
Will emerge but once — and dumb —<br>
To the Sepulchre —</p>
