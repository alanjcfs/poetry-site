<p>Promise This — When You be Dying —<br>
Some shall summon Me —<br>
Mine belong Your latest Sighing —<br>
Mine — to Belt Your Eye —<br><br>
Not with Coins — though they be Minted<br>
From an Emperor's Hand —<br>
Be my lips — the only Buckle<br>
Your low Eyes — demand —<br><br>
Mine to stay — when all have wandered —<br>
To devise once more<br>
If the Life be too surrendered —<br>
Life of Mine — restore —<br><br>
Poured like this — My Whole Libation —<br>
Just that You should see<br>
Bliss of Death — Life's Bliss extol thro'<br>
Imitating You —<br><br>
Mine — to guard Your Narrow Precinct —<br>
To seduce the Sun<br>
Longest on Your South, to linger,<br>
Largest Dews of Morn<br><br>
To demand, in Your low favor<br>
Lest the Jealous Grass<br>
Greener lean — Or fonder cluster<br>
Round some other face —<br><br>
Mine to supplicate Madonna —<br>
If Madonna be<br>
Could behold so far a Creature —<br>
Christ — omitted — Me —<br><br>
Just to follow Your dear future —<br>
Ne'er so far behind —<br>
For My Heaven —<br>
Had I not been<br>
Most enough — denied?</p>
