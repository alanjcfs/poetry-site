<p>The Soul's Superior instants<br>
Occur to Her — alone —<br>
When friend — and Earth's occasion<br>
Have infinite withdrawn —<br><br>
Or She — Herself — ascended<br>
To too remote a Height<br>
For lower Recognition<br>
Than Her Omnipotent —<br><br>
This Mortal Abolition<br>
Is seldom — but as fair<br>
As Apparition — subject<br>
To Autocratic Air —<br><br>
Eternity's disclosure<br>
To favorites — a few —<br>
Of the Colossal substance<br>
Of Immortality</p>
