<p>Each Life Converges to some Centre —<br>
Expressed — or still —<br>
Exists in every Human Nature<br>
A Goal —<br><br>
Embodied scarcely to itself — it may be —<br>
Too fair<br>
For Credibility's presumption<br>
To mar —<br><br>
Adored with caution — as a Brittle Heaven —<br>
To reach<br>
Were hopeless, as the Rainbow's Raiment<br>
To touch —<br><br>
Yet persevered toward — sure — for the Distance —<br>
How high —<br>
Unto the Saint's slow diligence —<br>
The Sky —<br><br>
Ungained — it may be — by a Life's low Venture —<br>
But then —<br>
Eternity enable the endeavoring<br>
Again.</p>
