<p>Dust is the only Secret —<br>
Death, the only One<br>
You cannot find out all about<br>
In his "native town."<br>
<br>
Nobody know "his Father" —<br>
Never was a Boy —<br>
Hadn't any playmates,<br>
Or "Early history" —<br>
<br>
Industrious! Laconic!<br>
Punctual! Sedate!<br>
Bold as a Brigand!<br>
Stiller than a Fleet!<br>
<br>
Builds, like a Bird, too!<br>
Christ robs the Nest —<br>
Robin after Robin<br>
Smuggled to Rest!</p>
