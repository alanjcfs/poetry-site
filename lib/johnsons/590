<p>Did you ever stand in a Cavern's Mouth —<br>
Widths out of the Sun —<br>
And look — and shudder, and block your breath —<br>
And deem to be alone<br>
<br>
In such a place, what horror,<br>
How Goblin it would be —<br>
And fly, as 'twere pursuing you?<br>
Then Loneliness — looks so —<br>
<br>
Did you ever look in a Cannon's face —<br>
Between whose Yellow eye —<br>
And yours — the Judgment intervened —<br>
The Question of "To die" —<br>
<br>
Extemporizing in your ear<br>
As cool as Satyr's Drums —<br>
If you remember, and were saved —<br>
It's liker so — it seems —</p>
