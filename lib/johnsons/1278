<p>The Mountains stood in Haze —<br>
The Valleys stopped below<br>
And went or waited as they liked<br>
The River and the Sky.<br><br>
At leisure was the Sun —<br>
His interests of Fire<br>
A little from remark withdrawn —<br>
The Twilight spoke the Spire,<br><br>
So soft upon the Scene<br>
The Act of evening fell<br>
We felt how neighborly a Thing<br>
Was the Invisible.</p>
