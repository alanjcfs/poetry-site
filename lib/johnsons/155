<p>The Murmur of a Bee<br>
A Witchcraft — yieldeth me —<br>
If any ask me why —<br>
'Twere easier to die —<br>
Than tell —<br><br>
The Red upon the Hill<br>
Taketh away my will —<br>
If anybody sneer —<br>
Take care — for God is here —<br>
That's all.<br><br>
The Breaking of the Day<br>
Addeth to my Degree —<br>
If any ask me how —<br>
Artist — who drew me so —<br>
Must tell!</p>
