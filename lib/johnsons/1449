<p>I thought the Train would never come —<br>
How slow the whistle sang —<br>
I don't believe a peevish Bird<br>
So whimpered for the Spring —<br>
I taught my Heart a hundred times<br>
Precisely what to say —<br>
Provoking Lover, when you came<br>
Its Treatise flew away<br>
To hide my strategy too late<br>
To wiser be too soon —<br>
For miseries so halcyon<br>
The happiness atone —</p>
