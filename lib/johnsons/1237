<p>My Heart ran so to thee<br>
It would not wait for me<br>
And I affronted grew<br>
And drew away<br><br>
For whatsoe'er my pace<br>
He first achieve they Face<br>
How general a Grace<br>
Allotted two —<br><br>
Not in malignity<br>
Mentioned I this to thee —<br>
Had he obliquity<br>
Soonest to share<br>
But for the Greed of him —<br>
Boasting my Premium —<br>
Basking in Bethleem<br>
Ere I be there —</p>
