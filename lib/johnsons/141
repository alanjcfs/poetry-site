<p>Some, too fragile for winter winds<br>
The thoughtful grave encloses —<br>
Tenderly tucking them in from frost<br>
Before their feet are cold.<br><br>
Never the treasures in her nest<br>
The cautious grave exposes,<br>
Building where schoolboy dare not look,<br>
And sportsman is not bold.<br><br>
This covert have all the children<br>
Early aged, and often cold,<br>
Sparrow, unnoticed by the Father —<br>
Lambs for whom time had not a fold.</p>
