<p>You taught me Waiting with Myself —<br>
Appointment strictly kept —<br>
You taught me fortitude of Fate —<br>
This — also — I have learnt —<br><br>
An Altitude of Death, that could<br>
No bitterer debar<br>
Than Life — had done — before it —<br>
Yet — there is a Science more —<br><br>
The Heaven you know — to understand<br>
That you be not ashamed<br>
Of Me — in Christ's bright Audience<br>
Upon the further Hand —</p>
