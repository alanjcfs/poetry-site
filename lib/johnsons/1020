<p>Trudging to Eden, looking backward,<br>
I met Somebody's little Boy<br>
Asked him his name — He lisped me "Trotwood" —<br>
Lady, did He belong to thee?<br><br>
Would it comfort — to know I met him —<br>
And that He didn't look afraid?<br>
I couldn't weep — for so many smiling<br>
New Acquaintance — this Baby made —</p>
