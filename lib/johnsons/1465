<p>Before you thought of Spring<br>
Except as a Surmise<br>
You see — God bless his suddenness —<br>
A Fellow in the Skies<br>
Of independent Hues<br>
A little weather worn<br>
Inspiriting habiliments<br>
Of Indigo and Brown —<br>
With specimens of Song<br>
As if for you to choose —<br>
Discretion in the interval<br>
With gay delays he goes<br>
To some superior Tree<br>
Without a single Leaf<br>
And shouts for joy to Nobody<br>
But his seraphic self —</p>
