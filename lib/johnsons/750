<p>Growth of Man — like Growth of Nature —<br>
Gravitates within —<br>
Atmosphere, and Sun endorse it —<br>
Bit it stir — alone —<br><br>
Each — its difficult Ideal<br>
Must achieve — Itself —<br>
Through the solitary prowess<br>
Of a Silent Life —<br><br>
Effort — is the sole condition —<br>
Patience of Itself —<br>
Patience of opposing forces —<br>
And intact Belief —<br><br>
Looking on — is the Department<br>
Of its Audience —<br>
But Transaction — is assisted<br>
By no Countenance —</p>
