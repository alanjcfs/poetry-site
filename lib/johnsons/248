<p>Why — do they shut Me out of Heaven?<br>
Did I sing — too loud?<br>
But — I can say a little "Minor"<br>
Timid as a Bird!<br><br>
Wouldn't the Angels try me —<br>
Just — once — more —<br>
Just — see — if I troubled them —<br>
But don't — shut the door!<br><br>
Oh, if I — were the Gentleman<br>
In the "White Robe" —<br>
And they — were the little Hand — that knocked —<br>
Could — I — forbid?</p>
