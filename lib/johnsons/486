<p>I was the slightest in the House —<br>
I took the smallest Room —<br>
At night, my little Lamp, and Book —<br>
And one Geranium —<br>
<br>
So stationed I could catch the Mint<br>
That never ceased to fall —<br>
And just my Basket —<br>
Let me think — I'm sure —<br>
That this was all —<br>
<br>
I never spoke — unless addressed —<br>
And then, 'twas brief and low —<br>
I could not bear to live — aloud —<br>
The Racket shamed me so —<br>
<br>
And if it had not been so far —<br>
And any one I knew<br>
Were going — I had often thought<br>
How noteless — I could die —</p>
