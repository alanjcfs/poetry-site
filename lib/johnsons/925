<p>Struck, was I, not yet by Lightning —<br>
Lightning — lets away<br>
Power to perceive His Process<br>
With Vitality.<br><br>
Maimed — was I — yet not by Venture —<br>
Stone of stolid Boy —<br>
Nor a Sportsman's Peradventure —<br>
Who mine Enemy?<br><br>
Robbed — was I — intact to Bandit —<br>
All my Mansion torn —<br>
Sun — withdrawn to Recognition —<br>
Furthest shining — done —<br><br>
Yet was not the foe — of any —<br>
Not the smallest Bird<br>
In the nearest Orchard dwelling<br>
Be of Me — afraid.<br><br>
Most — I love the Cause that slew Me.<br>
Often as I die<br>
Its beloved Recognition<br>
Holds a Sun on Me —<br><br>
Best — at Setting — as is Nature's —<br>
Neither witnessed Rise<br>
Till the infinite Aurora<br>
In the other's eyes.</p>
