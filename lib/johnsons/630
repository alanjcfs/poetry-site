<p>The Lightning playeth — all the while —<br>
But when He singeth — then —<br>
Ourselves are conscious He exist —<br>
And we approach Him — stern —<br><br>
With Insulators — and a Glove —<br>
Whose short — sepulchral Bass<br>
Alarms us — tho' His Yellow feet<br>
May pass — and counterpass —<br><br>
Upon the Ropes — above our Head —<br>
Continual — with the News —<br>
Nor We so much as check our speech —<br>
Nor stop to cross Ourselves —</p>
