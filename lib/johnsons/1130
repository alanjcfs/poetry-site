<p>That odd old man is dead a year —<br>
We miss his stated Hat.<br>
'Twas such an evening bright and stiff<br>
His faded lamp went out.<br><br>
Who miss his antiquated Wick —<br>
Are any hoar for him?<br>
Waits any indurated mate<br>
His wrinkled coming Home?<br><br>
Oh Life, begun in fluent Blood<br>
And consummated dull!<br>
Achievement contemplating thee —<br>
Feels transitive and cool.</p>
