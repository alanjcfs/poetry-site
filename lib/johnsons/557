<p>She hideth Her the last —<br>
And is the first, to rise —<br>
Her Night doth hardly recompense<br>
The Closing of Her eyes —<br><br>
She doth Her Purple Work —<br>
And putteth Her away<br>
In low Apartments in the Sod -<br>
As worthily as We.<br><br>
To imitate her life<br>
As impotent would be<br>
As make of Our imperfect Mints,<br>
The Julep — of the Bee —</p>
