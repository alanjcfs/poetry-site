<p>The Admirations — and Contempts — of time —<br>
Show justest — through an Open Tomb —<br>
The Dying — as it were a Height<br>
Reorganizes Estimate<br>
And what We saw not<br>
We distinguish clear —<br>
And mostly — see not<br>
What We saw before —<br><br>
'Tis Compound Vision —<br>
Light — enabling Light —<br>
The Finite — furnished<br>
With the Infinite —<br>
Convex — and Concave Witness —<br>
Back — toward Time —<br>
And forward —<br>
Toward the God of Him —</p>
