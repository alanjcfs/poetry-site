<p>I reason, earth is short,<br>
And anguish absolute,<br>
And many hurt<br>
But what of that?<br>
<br>
I reason, we could die:<br>
The best vitality<br>
Cannot excel decay<br>
But what of that?<br>
<br>
I reason that in heaven<br>
Somehow, it will be even,<br>
Some new equation given<br>
But what of that?</p>
