<p>I cannot dance upon my Toes —<br>
No Man instructed me —<br>
But oftentimes, among my mind,<br>
A Glee possesseth me,<br>
<br>
That had I Ballet knowledge —<br>
Would put itself abroad<br>
In Pirouette to blanch a Troupe —<br>
Or lay a Prima, mad,<br>
<br>
And though I had no Gown of Gauze —<br>
No Ringlet, to my Hair,<br>
Nor hopped to Audiences — like Birds,<br>
One Claw upon the Air,<br>
<br>
Nor tossed my shape in Eider Balls,<br>
Nor rolled on wheels of snow<br>
Till I was out of sight, in sound,<br>
The House encore me so —<br>
<br>
Nor any know I know the Art<br>
I mention — easy — Here —<br>
Nor any Placard boast me —<br>
It's full as Opera —</p>
