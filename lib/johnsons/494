<p>Going to Him! Happy letter!<br>
Tell Him —<br>
Tell Him the page I didn't write —<br>
Tell Him — I only said the Syntax —<br>
And left the Verb and the pronoun out —<br>
Tell Him just how the fingers hurried —<br>
Then — how they waded — slow — slow —<br>
And then you wished you had eyes in your pages —<br>
So you could see what moved them so —<br><br>
Tell Him — it wasn't a Practised Writer —<br>
You guessed — from the way the sentence toiled —<br>
You could hear the Bodice tug, behind you —<br>
As if it held but the might of a child —<br>
You almost pitied it — you — it worked so —<br>
Tell Him — no — you may quibble there —<br>
For it would split His Heart, to know it —<br>
And then you and I, were silenter.<br><br>
Tell Him — Night finished — before we finished —<br>
And the Old Clock kept neighing "Day"!<br>
And you — got sleepy — and begged to be ended —<br>
What could it hinder so — to say?<br>
Tell Him — just how she sealed you — Cautious!<br>
But — if He ask where you are hid<br>
Until tomorrow — Happy letter!<br>
Gesture Coquette — and shake your Head!</p>
