<p>I meant to have but modest needs —<br>
Such as Content — and Heaven —<br>
Within my income — these could lie<br>
And Life and I — keep even —<br>
<br>
But since the last — included both —<br>
It would suffice my Prayer<br>
But just for One — to stipulate —<br>
And Grace would grant the Pair —<br>
<br>
And so — upon this wise — I prayed —<br>
Great Spirit — Give to me<br>
A Heaven not so large as Yours,<br>
But large enough — for me —<br>
<br>
A Smile suffused Jehovah's face —<br>
The Cherubim — withdrew —<br>
Grave Saints stole out to look at me —<br>
And showed their dimples — too —<br>
<br>
I left the Place, with all my might —<br>
I threw my Prayer away —<br>
The Quiet Ages picked it up —<br>
And Judgment — twinkled — too —<br>
Tat one so honest — be extant —<br>
It take the Tale for true —<br>
That "Whatsoever Ye shall ask —<br>
Itself be given You" —<br>
<br>
But I, grown shrewder — scan the Skies<br>
With a suspicious Air —<br>
As Children — swindled for the first<br>
All Swindlers — be — infer —</p>
