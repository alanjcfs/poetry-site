<p>Awake ye muses nine, sing me a strain divine,<br>
Unwind the solemn twine, and tie my Valentine!<br><br>
Oh the Earth was made for lovers, for damsel, and hopeless swain,<br>
For sighing, and gentle whispering, and unity made of twain.<br>
All things do go a courting, in earth, or sea, or air,<br>
God hath made nothing single but thee in His world so fair!<br>
The bride, and then the bridegroom, the two, and then the one,<br>
Adam, and Eve, his consort, the moon, and then the sun;<br>
The life doth prove the precept, who obey shall happy be,<br>
Who will not serve the sovereign, be hanged on fatal tree.<br>
The high do seek the lowly, the great do seek the small,<br>
None cannot find who seeketh, on this terrestrial ball;<br>
The bee doth court the flower, the flower his suit receives,<br>
And they make merry wedding, whose guests are hundred leaves;<br>
The wind doth woo the branches, the branches they are won,<br>
And the father fond demandeth the maiden for his son.<br>
The storm doth walk the seashore humming a mournful tune,<br>
The wave with eye so pensive, looketh to see the moon,<br>
Their spirits meet together, they make their solemn vows,<br>
No more he singeth mournful, her sadness she doth lose.<br>
The worm doth woo the mortal, death claims a living bride,<br>
Night unto day is married, morn unto eventide;<br>
Earth is a merry damsel, and heaven a knight so true,<br>
And Earth is quite coquettish, and beseemeth in vain to sue.<br>
Now to the application, to the reading of the roll,<br>
To bringing thee to justice, and marshalling thy soul:<br>
Thou art a human solo, a being cold, and lone,<br>
Wilt have no kind companion, thou reap'st what thou hast sown.<br>
Hast never silent hours, and minutes all too long,<br>
And a deal of sad reflection, and wailing instead of song?<br>
There's Sarah, and Eliza, and Emeline so fair,<br>
And Harriet, and Susan, and she with curling hair!<br>
Thine eyes are sadly blinded, but yet thou mayest see<br>
Six true, and comely maidens sitting upon the tree;<br>
Approach that tree with caution, then up it boldly climb,<br>
And seize the one thou lovest, nor care for space, or time!<br>
Then bear her to the greenwood, and build for her a bower,<br>
And give her what she asketh, jewel, or bird, or flower —<br>
And bring the fife, and trumpet, and beat upon the drum —<br>
And bid the world Goodmorrow, and go to glory home!</p>
