<p>I am ashamed — I hide —<br>
What right have I — to be a Bride —<br>
So late a Dowerless Girl —<br>
Nowhere to hide my dazzled Face —<br>
No one to teach me that new Grace —<br>
Nor introduce — my Soul —<br>
<br>
Me to adorn — How — tell —<br>
Trinket — to make Me beautiful —<br>
Fabrics of Cashmere —<br>
Never a Gown of Dun — more —<br>
Raiment instead — of Pompadour —<br>
For Me — My soul — to wear —<br>
<br>
Fingers — to frame my Round Hair<br>
Oval — as Feudal Ladies wore —<br>
Far Fashions — Fair —<br>
Skill to hold my Brow like an Earl —<br>
Plead — like a Whippoorwill —<br>
Prove — like a Pearl —<br>
Then, for Character —<br>
Fashion My Spirit quaint — white —<br>
Quick — like a Liquor —<br>
Gay — like Light —<br>
Bring Me my best Pride —<br>
No more ashamed —<br>
No more to hide —<br>
Meek — let it be — too proud — for Pride —<br>
Baptized — this Day — a Bride —</p>
