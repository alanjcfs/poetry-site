<p>She lay as if at play<br>
Her life had leaped away —<br>
Intending to return —<br>
But not so soon —<br><br>
Her merry Arms, half dropt —<br>
As if for lull of sport —<br>
An instant had forgot —<br>
The Trick to start —<br><br>
Her dancing Eyes — ajar —<br>
As if their Owner were<br>
Still sparkling through<br>
For fun — at you —<br><br>
Her Morning at the door —<br>
Devising, I am sure —<br>
To force her sleep —<br>
So light — so deep —</p>
