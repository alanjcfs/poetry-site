<p>Summer — we all have seen —<br>
A few of us — believed —<br>
A few — the more aspiring<br>
Unquestionably loved —<br><br>
But Summer does not care —<br>
She goes her spacious way<br>
As eligible as the moon<br>
To our Temerity —<br><br>
The Doom to be adored —<br>
The Affluence conferred —<br>
Unknown as to an Ecstasy<br>
The Embryo endowed —</p>
