<p>Were natural mortal lady<br>
Who had so little time<br>
To pack her trunk and order<br>
The great exchange of clime —<br><br>
How rapid, how momentous —<br>
What exigencies were —<br>
But nature will be ready<br>
And have an hour to spare.<br><br>
To make some trifle fairer<br>
That was too fair before —<br>
Enchanting by remaining,<br>
And by departure more.</p>
