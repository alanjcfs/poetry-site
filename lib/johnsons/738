<p>You said that I "was Great" — one Day —<br>
Then "Great" it be — if that please Thee —<br>
Or Small — or any size at all —<br>
Nay — I'm the size suit Thee —<br><br>
Tall — like the Stag — would that?<br>
Or lower — like the Wren —<br>
Or other heights of Other Ones<br>
I've seen?<br><br>
Tell which — it's dull to guess —<br>
And I must be Rhinoceros<br>
Or Mouse —<br>
At once — for Thee —<br><br>
So say — if Queen it be —<br>
Or Page — please Thee —<br>
I'm that — or nought —<br>
Or other thing — if other thing there be —<br>
With just this Stipulus —<br>
I suit Thee —</p>
