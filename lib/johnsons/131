<p>Besides the Autumn poets sing<br>
A few prosaic days<br>
A little this side of the snow<br>
And that side of the Haze —<br>
<br>
A few incisive Mornings —<br>
A few Ascetic Eves —<br>
Gone — Mr. Bryant's "Golden Rod" —<br>
And Mr. Thomson's "sheaves."<br>
<br>
Still, is the bustle in the Brook —<br>
Sealed are the spicy valves —<br>
Mesmeric fingers softly touch<br>
The Eyes of many Elves —<br>
<br>
Perhaps a squirrel may remain —<br>
My sentiments to share —<br>
Grant me, Oh Lord, a sunny mind —<br>
Thy windy will to bear!</p>
