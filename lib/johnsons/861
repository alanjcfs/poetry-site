<p>Split the Lark — and you'll find the Music —<br>
Bulb after Bulb, in Silver rolled —<br>
Scantilly dealt to the Summer Morning<br>
Saved for your Ear when Lutes be old.<br><br>
Loose the Flood — you shall find it patent —<br>
Gush after Gush, reserved for you —<br>
Scarlet Experiment! Sceptic Thomas!<br>
Now, do you doubt that your Bird was true?</p>
