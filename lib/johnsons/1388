<p>Those cattle smaller than a Bee<br>
That herd upon the eye —<br>
Whose tillage is the passing Crumb —<br>
Those Cattle are the Fly —<br>
Of Barns for Winter — blameless —<br>
Extemporaneous stalls<br>
They found to our objection —<br>
On eligible walls —<br>
Reserving the presumption<br>
To suddenly descend<br>
And gallop on the Furniture —<br>
Or odiouser offend —<br>
Of their peculiar calling<br>
Unqualified to judge<br>
To Nature we remand them<br>
To justify or scourge —</p>
