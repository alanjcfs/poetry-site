<p>The Lilac is an ancient shrub<br>
But ancienter than that<br>
The Firmamental Lilac<br>
Upon the Hill tonight —<br>
The Sun subsiding on his Course<br>
Bequeaths this final Plant<br>
To Contemplation — not to Touch —<br>
The Flower of Occident.<br>
Of one Corolla is the West —<br>
The Calyx is the Earth —<br>
The Capsules burnished Seeds the Stars<br>
The Scientist of Faith<br>
His research has but just begun —<br>
Above his synthesis<br>
The Flora unimpeachable<br>
To Time's Analysis —<br>
"Eye hath not seen" may possibly<br>
Be current with the Blind<br>
But let not Revelation<br>
By theses be detained —</p>
