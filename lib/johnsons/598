<p>Three times — we parted — Breath — and I —<br>
Three times — He would not go —<br>
But strove to stir the lifeless Fan<br>
The Waters — strove to stay.<br><br>
Three Times — the Billows tossed me up —<br>
Then caught me — like a Ball —<br>
Then made Blue faces in my face —<br>
And pushed away a sail<br><br>
That crawled Leagues off — I liked to see —<br>
For thinking — while I die —<br>
How pleasant to behold a Thing<br>
Where Human faces — be —<br><br>
The Waves grew sleepy — Breath — did not —<br>
The Winds — like Children — lulled —<br>
Then Sunrise kissed my Chrysalis —<br>
And I stood up — and lived —</p>
