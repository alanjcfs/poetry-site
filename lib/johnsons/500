<p>Within my Garden, rides a Bird<br>
Upon a single Wheel —<br>
Whose spokes a dizzy Music make<br>
As 'twere a travelling Mill —<br><br>
He never stops, but slackens<br>
Above the Ripest Rose —<br>
Partakes without alighting<br>
And praises as he goes,<br><br>
Till every spice is tasted —<br>
And then his Fairy Gig<br>
Reels in remoter atmospheres —<br>
And I rejoin my Dog,<br><br>
And He and I, perplex us<br>
If positive, 'twere we —<br>
Or bore the Garden in the Brain<br>
This Curiosity —<br><br>
But He, the best Logician,<br>
Refers my clumsy eye —<br>
To just vibrating Blossoms!<br>
An Exquisite Reply!</p>
