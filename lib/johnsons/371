<p>A precious — mouldering pleasure — 'tis —<br>
To meet an Antique Book —<br>
In just the Dress his Century wore —<br>
A privilege — I think —<br><br>
His venerable Hand to take —<br>
And warming in our own —<br>
A passage back — or two — to make —<br>
To Times when he — was young —<br><br>
His quaint opinions — to inspect —<br>
His thought to ascertain<br>
On Themes concern our mutual mind —<br>
The Literature of Man —<br><br>
What interested Scholars — most —<br>
What Competitions ran —<br>
When Plato — was a Certainty —<br>
And Sophocles — a Man —<br><br>
When Sappho — was a living Girl —<br>
And Beatrice wore<br>
The Gown that Dante — deified —<br>
Facts Centuries before<br><br>
He traverses — familiar —<br>
As One should come to Town —<br>
And tell you all your Dreams — were true —<br>
He lived — where Dreams were born —<br><br>
His presence is Enchantment —<br>
You beg him not to go —<br>
Old Volume shake their Vellum Heads<br>
And tantalize — just so —</p>
