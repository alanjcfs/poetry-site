<p>The murmuring of Bees, has ceased<br>
But murmuring of some<br>
Posterior, prophetic,<br>
Has simultaneous come.<br>
The lower metres of the Year<br>
When Nature's laugh is done<br>
The Revelations of the Book<br>
Whose Genesis was June.<br>
Appropriate Creatures to her change<br>
The Typic Mother sends<br>
As Accent fades to interval<br>
With separating Friends<br>
Till what we speculate, has been<br>
And thoughts we will not show<br>
More intimate with us become<br>
Than Persons, that we know.</p>
