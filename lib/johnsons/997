<p>Crumbling is not an instant's Act<br>
A fundamental pause<br>
Dilapidation's processes<br>
Are organized Decays.<br>
<br>
'Tis first a Cobweb on the Soul<br>
A Cuticle of Dust<br>
A Borer in the Axis<br>
An Elemental Rust —<br>
<br>
Ruin is formal — Devil's work<br>
Consecutive and slow —<br>
Fail in an instant, no man did<br>
Slipping — is Crash's law.</p>
