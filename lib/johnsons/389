<p>There's been a Death, in the Opposite House,<br>
As lately as Today —<br>
I know it, by the numb look<br>
Such Houses have — alway —<br><br>
The Neighbors rustle in and out —<br>
The Doctor — drives away —<br>
A Window opens like a Pod —<br>
Abrupt — mechanically —<br><br>
Somebody flings a Mattress out —<br>
The Children hurry by —<br>
They wonder if it died — on that —<br>
I used to — when a Boy —<br><br>
The Minister — goes stiffly in —<br>
As if the House were His —<br>
And He owned all the Mourners — now —<br>
And little Boys — besides —<br><br>
And then the Milliner — and the Man<br>
Of the Appalling Trade —<br>
To take the measure of the House —<br><br>
There'll be that Dark Parade —<br><br>
Of Tassels — and of Coaches — soon —<br>
It's easy as a Sign —<br>
The Intuition of the News —<br>
In just a Country Town —</p>
