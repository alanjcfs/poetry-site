<p>A single Screw of Flesh<br>
Is all that pins the Soul<br>
That stands for Deity, to Mine,<br>
Upon my side the Veil —<br><br>
Once witnessed of the Gauze —<br>
Its name is put away<br>
As far from mine, as if no plight<br>
Had printed yesterday,<br><br>
In tender — solemn Alphabet,<br>
My eyes just turned to see,<br>
When it was smuggled by my sight<br>
Into Eternity —<br><br>
More Hands — to hold — These are but Two —<br>
One more new-mailed Nerve<br>
Just granted, for the Peril's sake —<br>
Some striding — Giant — Love —<br><br>
So greater than the Gods can show,<br>
They slink before the Clay,<br>
That not for all their Heaven can boast<br>
Will let its Keepsake — go</p>
