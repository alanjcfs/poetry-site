<p>Did Our Best Moment last —<br>
'Twould supersede the Heaven —<br>
A few — and they by Risk — procure —<br>
So this Sort — are not given —<br>
<br>
Except as stimulants — in<br>
Cases of Despair —<br>
Or Stupor — The Reserve —<br>
These Heavenly Moments are —<br>
<br>
A Grant of the Divine —<br>
That Certain as it Comes —<br>
Withdraws — and leaves the dazzled Soul<br>
In her unfurnished Rooms</p>
