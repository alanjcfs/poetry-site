<p>He strained my faith —<br>
Did he find it supple?<br>
Shook my strong trust —<br>
Did it then — yield?<br>
<br>
Hurled my belief —<br>
But — did he shatter — it?<br>
Racked — with suspense —<br>
Not a nerve failed!<br>
<br>
Wrung me — with Anguish —<br>
But I never doubted him —<br>
'Tho' for what wrong<br>
He did never say —<br>
<br>
Stabbed — while I sued<br>
His sweet forgiveness —<br>
Jesus — it's your little "John"!<br>
Don't you know — me?</p>
