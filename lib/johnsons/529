<p>I'm sorry for the Dead — Today —<br>
It's such congenial times<br>
Old Neighbors have at fences —<br>
It's time o' year for Hay.<br><br>
And Broad — Sunburned Acquaintance<br>
Discourse between the Toil —<br>
And laugh, a homely species<br>
That makes the Fences smile —<br><br>
It seems so straight to lie away<br>
From all of the noise of Fields —<br>
The Busy Carts — the fragrant Cocks —<br>
The Mower's Metre — Steals —<br><br>
A Trouble lest they're homesick —<br>
Those Farmers — and their Wives —<br>
Set separate from the Farming —<br>
And all the Neighbors' lives —<br><br>
A Wonder if the Sepulchre<br>
Don't feel a lonesome way —<br>
When Men — and Boys — and Carts — and June,<br>
Go down the Fields to "Hay" —</p>
