<p>The Winters are so short —<br>
I'm hardly justified<br>
In sending all the Birds away —<br>
And moving into Pod —<br><br>
Myself — for scarcely settled —<br>
The Phoebes have begun —<br>
And then — it's time to strike my Tent —<br>
And open House — again —<br><br>
It's mostly, interruptions —<br>
My Summer — is despoiled —<br>
Because there was a Winter — once —<br>
And al the Cattle — starved —<br><br>
And so there was a Deluge —<br>
And swept the World away —<br>
But Ararat's a Legend — now —<br>
And no one credits Noah —</p>
