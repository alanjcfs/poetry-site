<p>I think the longest Hour of all<br>
Is when the Cars have come —<br>
And we are waiting for the Coach —<br>
It seems as though the Time<br><br>
Indignant — that the Joy was come —<br>
Did block the Gilded Hands —<br>
And would not let the Seconds by —<br>
But slowest instant — ends —<br><br>
The Pendulum begins to count —<br>
Like little Scholars — loud —<br>
The steps grow thicker — in the Hall —<br>
The Heart begins to crowd —<br><br>
Then I — my timid service done —<br>
Tho' service 'twas, of Love —<br>
Take up my little Violin —<br>
And further North — remove.</p>
