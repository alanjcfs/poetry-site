<p>My little devices to live till Monday would woo your sad attention - Full of work and plots and little happinesses the Thought of you protracts them all and makes them sham and cold -<br>
      How fleet - how indiscreet an one -<br>
      how always wrong is Love -<br>
      The joyful little Deity<br>
      We are not scourged to serve -</p>
