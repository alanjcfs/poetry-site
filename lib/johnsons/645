<p>Bereavement in their death to feel<br>
Whom We have never seen —<br>
A Vital Kinsmanship import<br>
Our Soul and theirs — between —<br>
<br>
For Stranger — Strangers do not mourn —<br>
There be Immortal friends<br>
Whom Death see first — 'tis news of this<br>
That paralyze Ourselves —<br>
<br>
Who, vital only to Our Thought —<br>
Such Presence bear away<br>
In dying — 'tis as if Our Souls<br>
Absconded — suddenly —</p>
