<p>'Tis not that Dying hurts us so —<br>
'Tis Living — hurts us more —<br>
But Dying — is a different way —<br>
A Kind behind the Door —<br><br>
The Southern Custom — of the Bird —<br>
That ere the Frosts are due —<br>
Accepts a better Latitude —<br>
We — are the Birds — that stay.<br><br>
The Shrivers round Farmers' doors —<br>
For whose reluctant Crumb —<br>
We stipulate — till pitying Snows<br>
Persuade our Feathers Home.</p>
