<p>Bee! I'm expecting you!<br>
Was saying Yesterday<br>
To Somebody you know<br>
That you were due —<br>
<br>
The Frogs got Home last Week —<br>
Are settled, and at work —<br>
Birds, mostly back —<br>
The Clover warm and thick —<br>
<br>
You'll get my Letter by<br>
The seventeenth; Reply<br>
Or better, be with me —<br>
Yours, Fly.</p>
