<p>A Bird came down the Walk —<br>
He did not know I saw —<br>
He bit an Angleworm in halves<br>
And ate the fellow, raw,<br><br>
And then he drank a Dew<br>
From a convenient Grass —<br>
And then hopped sidewise to the Wall<br>
To let a Beetle pass —<br><br>
He glanced with rapid eyes<br>
That hurried all around —<br>
They looked like frightened Beads, I thought —<br>
He stirred his Velvet Head<br><br>
Like one in danger, Cautious,<br>
I offered him a Crumb<br>
And he unrolled his feathers<br>
And rowed him softer home —<br><br>
Than Oars divide the Ocean,<br>
Too silver for a seam —<br>
Or Butterflies, off Banks of Noon<br>
Leap, plashless as they swim.</p>
