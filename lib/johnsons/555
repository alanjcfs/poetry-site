<p>Trust in the Unexpected —<br>
By this — was William Kidd<br>
Persuaded of the Buried Gold —<br>
As One had testified —<br><br>
Through this — the old Philosopher —<br>
His Talismanic Stone<br>
Discerned — still withholden<br>
To effort undivine —<br><br>
'Twas this — allured Columbus —<br>
When Genoa — withdrew<br>
Before an Apparition<br>
Baptized America —<br><br>
The Same — afflicted Thomas —<br>
When Deity assured<br>
'Twas better — the perceiving not —<br>
Provided it believed —</p>
