<p>Their Barricade against the Sky<br>
The martial Trees withdraw<br>
And with a Flag at every turn<br>
Their Armies are no more.<br><br>
What Russet Halts in Nature's March<br>
They indicate or cause<br>
An inference of Mexico<br>
Effaces the Surmise —<br><br>
Recurrent to the After Mind<br>
That Massacre of Air —<br>
The Wound that was not Wound nor Scar<br>
But Holidays of War</p>
