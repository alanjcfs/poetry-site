<p>A Coffin — is a small Domain,<br>
Yet able to contain<br>
A Citizen of Paradise<br>
In it diminished Plane.<br><br>
A Grave — is a restricted Breadth —<br>
Yet ampler than the Sun —<br>
And all the Seas He populates<br>
And Lands He looks upon<br><br>
To Him who on its small Repose<br>
Bestows a single Friend —<br>
Circumference without Relief —<br>
Or Estimate — or End —</p>
