<p>It was given to me by the Gods —<br>
When I was a little Girl —<br>
They given us Presents most — you know —<br>
When we are new — and small.<br>
I kept it in my Hand —<br>
I never put it down —<br>
I did not dare to eat — or sleep —<br>
For fear it would be gone —<br>
I heard such words as "Rich" —<br>
When hurrying to school —<br>
From lips at Corners of the Streets —<br>
And wrestled with a smile.<br>
Rich! 'Twas Myself — was rich —<br>
To take the name of Gold —<br>
And Gold to own — in solid Bars —<br>
The Difference — made me bold —</p>
