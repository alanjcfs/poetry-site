<p>It's coming — the postponeless Creature —<br>
It gains the Block — and now — it gains the Door —<br>
Chooses its latch, from all the other fastenings —<br>
Enters — with a "You know Me — Sir"?<br>
<br>
Simple Salute — and certain Recognition —<br>
Bold — were it Enemy — Brief — were it friend —<br>
Dresses each House in Crape, and Icicle —<br>
And carries one — out of it — to God —</p>
