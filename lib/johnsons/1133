<p>The Snow that never drifts —<br>
The transient, fragrant snow<br>
That comes a single time a Year<br>
Is softly driving now —<br><br>
So thorough in the Tree<br>
At night beneath the star<br>
That it was February's Foot<br>
Experience would swear —<br><br>
Like Winter as a Face<br>
We stern and former knew<br>
Repaired of all but Loneliness<br>
By Nature's Alibi —<br><br>
Were every storm so spice<br>
The Value could not be —<br>
We buy with contrast — Pang is good<br>
As near as memory —</p>
