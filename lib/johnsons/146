<p>On such a night, or such a night,<br>
Would anybody care<br>
If such a little figure<br>
Slipped quiet from its chair —<br><br>
So quiet — Oh how quiet,<br>
That nobody might know<br>
But that the little figure<br>
Rocked softer — to and fro —<br><br>
On such a dawn, or such a dawn —<br>
Would anybody sigh<br>
That such a little figure<br>
Too sound asleep did lie<br><br>
For Chanticleer to wake it —<br>
Or stirring house below —<br>
Or giddy bird in orchard —<br>
Or early task to do?<br><br>
There was a little figure plump<br>
For every little knoll —<br>
Busy needles, and spools of thread —<br>
And trudging feet from school —<br><br>
Playmates, and holidays, and nuts —<br>
And visions vast and small —<br>
Strange that the feet so precious charged<br>
Should reach so small a goal!</p>
