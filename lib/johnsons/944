<p>I learned — at least — what Home could be —<br>
How ignorant I had been<br>
Of pretty ways of Covenant —<br>
How awkward at the Hymn<br><br>
Round our new Fireside — but for this —<br>
This pattern — of the Way —<br>
Whose Memory drowns me, like the Dip<br>
Of a Celestial Sea —<br><br>
What Mornings in our Garden — guessed —<br>
What Bees — for us — to hum —<br>
With only Birds to interrupt<br>
The Ripple of our Theme —<br><br>
And Task for Both —<br>
When Play be done —<br>
Your Problem — of the Brain —<br>
And mine — some foolisher effect —<br>
A Ruffle — or a Tune —<br><br>
The Afternoons — Together spent —<br>
And Twilight — in the Lanes —<br>
Some ministry to poorer lives —<br>
Seen poorest — thro' our gains —<br><br>
And then Return — and Night — and Home —<br><br>
And then away to You to pass —<br>
A new — diviner — care —<br>
Till Sunrise take us back to Scene —<br>
Transmuted — Vivider —<br><br>
This seems a Home —<br>
And Home is not —<br>
But what that Place could be —<br>
Afflicts me — as a Setting Sun —<br>
Where Dawn — knows how to be —</p>
