<p>"Houses" — so the Wise Men tell me —<br>
"Mansions"! Mansions must be warm!<br>
Mansions cannot let the tears in,<br>
Mansions must exclude the storm!<br>
<br>
"Many Mansions," by "his Father,"<br>
I don't know him; snugly built!<br>
Could the Children find the way there —<br>
Some, would even trudge tonight!</p>
