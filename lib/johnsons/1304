<p>Not with a Club, the Heart is broken<br>
Nor with a Stone —<br>
A Whip so small you could not see it<br>
I've known<br><br>
To lash the Magic Creature<br>
Till it fell,<br>
Yet that Whip's Name<br>
Too noble then to tell.<br><br>
Magnanimous as Bird<br>
By Boy descried —<br>
Singing unto the Stone<br>
Of which it died —<br><br>
Shame need not crouch<br>
In such an Earth as Ours —<br>
Shame — stand erect —<br>
The Universe is yours.</p>
