<p>My Life had stood — a Loaded Gun —<br>
In Corners — till a Day<br>
The Owner passed — identified —<br>
And carried Me away —<br><br>
And now We roam in Sovereign Woods —<br>
And now We hunt the Doe —<br>
And every time I speak for Him —<br>
The Mountains straight reply —<br><br>
And do I smile, such cordial light<br>
Upon the Valley glow —<br>
It is as a Vesuvian face<br>
Had let its pleasure through —<br><br>
And when at Night — Our good Day done —<br>
I guard My Master's Head —<br>
'Tis better than the Eider-Duck's<br>
Deep Pillow — to have shared —<br><br>
To foe of His — I'm deadly foe —<br>
None stir the second time —<br>
On whom I lay a Yellow Eye —<br>
Or an emphatic Thumb —<br><br>
Though I than He — may longer live<br>
He longer must — than I —<br>
For I have but the power to kill,<br>
Without — the power to die —</p>
