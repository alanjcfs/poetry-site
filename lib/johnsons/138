<p>Pigmy seraphs—gone astray—<br>
Velvet people from Vevay—<br>
Balles from some lost summer day—<br>
Bees exclusive Coterie—<br>
Paris could not lay the fold<br>
Belted down with Emerald—<br>
Venice could not show a check<br>
Of a tint so lustrous meek—<br>
Never such an Ambuscade<br>
As of briar and leaf displayed<br>
For my little damask maid—<br>
<br>
I had rather wear her grace<br>
Than an Earl’s distinguished face—<br>
I had rather dwell like her<br>
Than be “Duke of Exeter”—<br>
Royalty enough for me<br>
To subdue the Bumblebee.</p>
