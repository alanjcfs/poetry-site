<p>I live with Him — I see His face —<br>
I go no more away<br>
For Visitor — or Sundown —<br>
Death's single privacy<br>
<br>
The Only One — forestalling Mine —<br>
And that — by Right that He<br>
Presents a Claim invisible —<br>
No wedlock — granted Me —<br>
<br>
I live with Him — I hear His Voice —<br>
I stand alive — Today —<br>
To witness to the Certainty<br>
Of Immortality —<br>
<br>
Taught Me — by Time — the lower Way —<br>
Conviction — Every day —<br>
That Life like This — is stopless —<br>
Be Judgment — what it may —</p>
