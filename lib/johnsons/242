<p>When we stand on the tops of Things —<br>
And like the Trees, look down —<br>
The smoke all cleared away from it —<br>
And Mirrors on the scene —<br><br>
Just laying light — no soul will wink<br>
Except it have the flaw —<br>
The Sound ones, like the Hills — shall stand —<br>
No Lighting, scares away —<br><br>
The Perfect, nowhere be afraid —<br>
They bear their dauntless Heads,<br>
Where others, dare not go at Noon,<br>
Protected by their deeds —<br><br>
The Stars dare shine occasionally<br>
Upon a spotted World —<br>
And Suns, go surer, for their Proof,<br>
As if an Axle, held —</p>
