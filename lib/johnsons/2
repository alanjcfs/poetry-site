<p>The cows are going to pasture and little boys with their hands in their pockets are whistling to keep them warm. Dont think that the sky will frown so the day when you come home! She will smile and look happy, and be full of sunshine <i>then</i> - and even <i>should</i> she frown upon her child returning,<br><br>
there is <i>another</i> sky<br>
ever serene and fair,<br>
and there is <i>another</i> sunshine,<br>
tho' it be darkness there -<br>
never mind faded forets, Austin,<br>
never mind silent fields -<br><i>here</i> is a little forest<br>
whose leaf is ever green -<br>
here is a <i>brighter</i> garden -<br>
where not a frost has been,<br>
in its unfading flowers<br>
I hear the bright bee hum,<br>
prithee, my Brother,<br>
into <i>my</i> garden come!</p>
