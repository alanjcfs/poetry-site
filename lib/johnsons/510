<p>It was not Death, for I stood up,<br>
And all the Dead, lie down —<br>
It was not Night, for all the Bells<br>
Put out their Tongues, for Noon.<br><br>
It was not Frost, for on my Flesh<br>
I felt Siroccos — crawl —<br>
Nor Fire — for just my Marble feet<br>
Could keep a Chancel, cool —<br><br>
And yet, it tasted, like them all,<br>
The Figures I have seen<br>
Set orderly, for Burial,<br>
Reminded me, of mine —<br><br>
As if my life were shaven,<br>
And fitted to a frame,<br>
And could not breathe without a key,<br>
And 'twas like Midnight, some -<br><br>
When everything that ticked — has stopped —<br>
And Space stares all around —<br>
Or Grisly frosts — first Autumn morns,<br>
Repeal the Beating Ground —<br><br>
But, most, like Chaos - Stopless — cool —<br>
Without a Chance, or Spar —<br>
Or even a Report of Land —<br>
To justify — Despair.</p>
