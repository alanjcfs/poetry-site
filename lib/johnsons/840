<p>I cannot buy it — 'tis not sold —<br>
There is no other in the World —<br>
Mine was the only one<br><br>
I was so happy I forgot<br>
To shut the Door And it went out<br>
And I am all alone —<br><br>
If I could find it Anywhere<br>
I would not mind the journey there<br>
Though it took all my store<br><br>
But just to look it in the Eye —<br>
"Did'st thou?" "Thou did'st not mean," to say,<br>
Then, turn my Face away.</p>
