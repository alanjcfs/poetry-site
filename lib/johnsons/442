<p>God made a little Gentian —<br>
It tried — to be a Rose —<br>
And failed — and all the Summer laughed —<br>
But just before the Snows<br>
<br>
There rose a Purple Creature —<br>
That ravished all the Hill —<br>
And Summer hid her Forehead —<br>
And Mockery — was still —<br>
<br>
The Frosts were her condition —<br>
The Tyrian would not come<br>
Until the North — invoke it —<br>
Creator — Shall I — bloom?</p>
