<p>The little notes shall go as fast as steam can take them.<br>
Our hearts already went. Would we could mail our faces for your dear encouragement.<br>
      Remember The longest day that God appoints<br>
      Will finish with the sun.<br>
      Anguish can travel to it's stake,<br>
      And then it must return.</p>
