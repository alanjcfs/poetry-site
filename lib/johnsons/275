<p>Doubt Me! My Dim Companion!<br>
Why, God, would be content<br>
With but a fraction of the Life —<br>
Poured thee, without a stint —<br>
The whole of me — forever —<br>
What more the Woman can,<br>
Say quick, that I may dower thee<br>
With last Delight I own!<br>
<br>
It cannot be my Spirit —<br>
For that was thine, before —<br>
I ceded all of Dust I knew —<br>
What Opulence the more<br>
Had I — a freckled Maiden,<br>
Whose farthest of Degree,<br>
Was — that she might —<br>
Some distant Heaven,<br>
Dwell timidly, with thee!<br>
<br>
Sift her, from Brow to Barefoot!<br>
Strain till your last Surmise —<br>
Drop, like a Tapestry, away,<br>
Before the Fire's Eyes —<br>
Winnow her finest fondness —<br>
But hallow just the snow<br>
Intact, in Everlasting flake —<br>
Oh, Caviler, for you!</p>
