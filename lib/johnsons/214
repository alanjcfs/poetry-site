From tankards scooped in pearl;<br>
Not all the vats upon the Rhine<br>
Yield such an alcohol!<br><br>
Inebriate of air am I,<br>
And debauchee of dew,<br>
Reeling, through endless summer days,<br>
From inns of molten blue.<br><br>
When landlords turn the drunken bee<br>
Out of the foxglove's door,<br>
When butterflies renounce their drams,<br>
I shall but drink the more!<br><br>
Till seraphs swing their snowy hats,<br>
And saints to windows run,<br>
To see the little tippler<br>
Leaning against the sun!</p>
