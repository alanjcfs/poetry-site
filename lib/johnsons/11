<p>I never told the buried gold<br>
Opon the hill that lies -<br>
I saw the sun, his plunder done -<br>
Crouch low to guard his prize -<br><br>
He stood as near<br>
As stood you hear -<br>
A pace had been between -<br>
Did but a snake bisect the brake<br>
My life had forfeit been.<br><br>
That was a wondrous booty.<br>
I hope 'twas honest gained -<br>
Those were the fairest ingots<br>
That ever kissed the spade.<br><br>
Whether to keep the secret -<br>
Whether to reveal -<br>
Whether while I ponder<br>
Kidd may sudden sail -<br><br>
Could a shrewd advise me<br>
We might e'en divide -<br>
Should a shrewd <i>betray</i> me -<br>
"Atropos" decide -</p>

<p>I never told the buried gold<br>
Opon the hill - that lies -<br>
I saw the sun - his plunder done<br>
Crouch low to guard his prize.<br><br>
He stood as near<br>
As stood you hear -<br>
A pace had been between -<br>
Did but a snake bisect the brake<br>
My life had forfeit been.<br><br>
That was a wondrous booty -<br>
I hope 'twas honest gained.<br>
Those were the fairest ingots<br>
That ever kissed the spade!<br><br>
Whether to keep the secret -<br>
Whether to reveal -<br>
Whether as I ponder<br>
"Kidd" will sudden sail -<br><br>
Could a shrewd advise me<br>
We might e'en divide -<br>
Should a shrewd betray me -<br>
Atropos decide!</p>

<p>I never told the buried gold<br>
Upon the hill — that lies —<br>
I saw the sun — his plunder done<br>
Crouch low to guard his prize.<br><br>
He stood as near<br>
As stood you here —<br>
A pace had been between —<br>
Did but a snake bisect the brake<br>
My life had forfeit been.<br><br>
That was a wondrous booty —<br>
I hope 'twas honest gained.<br>
Those were the fairest ingots<br>
That ever kissed the spade!<br><br>
Whether to keep the secret —<br>
Whether to reveal —<br>
Whether as I ponder<br>
Kidd will sudden sail —<br><br>
Could a shrewd advise me<br>
We might e'en divide —<br>
Should a shrewd betray me —<br>
Atropos decide!</p>
