<p>As Frost is best conceived<br>
By force of its Result —<br>
Affliction is inferred<br>
By subsequent effect —<br><br>
If when the sun reveal,<br>
The Garden keep the Gash —<br>
If as the Days resume<br>
The wilted countenance<br><br>
Cannot correct the crease<br>
Or counteract the stain —<br>
Presumption is Vitality<br>
Was somewhere put in twain.</p>
