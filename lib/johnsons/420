<p>You'll know it — as you know 'tis Noon —<br>
By Glory —<br>
As you do the Sun —<br>
By Glory —<br>
As you will in Heaven —<br>
Know God the Father — and the Son.<br><br>
By intuition, Mightiest Things<br>
Assert themselves — and not by terms —<br>
"I'm Midnight" — need the Midnight say —<br>
"I'm Sunrise" — Need the Majesty?<br><br>
Omnipotence — had not a Tongue —<br>
His lisp — is Lightning — and the Sun —<br>
His Conversation — with the Sea —<br>
"How shall you know"?<br>
Consult your Eye!</p>
