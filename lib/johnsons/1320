<p>Dear March — Come in —<br>
How glad I am —<br>
I hoped for you before —<br>
<br>
Put down your Hat —<br>
You must have walked —<br>
How out of Breath you are —<br>
Dear March, Come right up the stairs with me —<br>
I have so much to tell —<br>
<br>
I got your Letter, and the Birds —<br>
The Maples never knew that you were coming — till I called<br>
I declare — how Red their Faces grew —<br>
But March, forgive me — and<br>
All those Hills you left for me to Hue —<br>
There was no Purple suitable —<br>
You took it all with you —<br>
<br>
Who knocks? That April.<br>
Lock the Door —<br>
I will not be pursued —<br>
He stayed away a Year to call<br>
When I am occupied —<br>
But trifles look so trivial<br>
As soon as you have come<br>
<br>
That Blame is just as dear as Praise<br>
And Praise as mere as Blame —</p>
