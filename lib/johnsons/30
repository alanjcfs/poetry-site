<p>Adrift! A little boat adrift!<br>
And night is coming down!<br>
Will <i>no</i> one guide a little boat<br>
Unto the nearest town?<br><br>
So Sailors say — on yesterday —<br>
Just as the dusk was brown<br>
One little boat gave up its strife<br>
And gurgled down and down.<br><br>
So angels say — on yesterday —<br>
Just as the dawn was red<br>
One little boat — o'erspent with gales —<br>
Retrimmed its masts — redecked its sails —<br>
And shot — exultant on!</p>
