<p>This Chasm, Sweet, opon my life<br>
I mention it to you,<br>
When Sunrise through a fissure drop<br>
The Day must follow too.<br><br>
If we demur, its gaping sides<br>
Disclose as 'twere a Tomb<br>
Ourself am lying straight wherein<br>
The Favorite of Doom.<br><br>
When it has just contained a Life<br>
Then, Darling, it will close<br>
And yet so bolder every Day<br>
So turbulent it grows<br><br>
I'm tempted half to stitch it up<br>
With a remaining Breath<br>
I should not miss in yielding, though<br>
To Him, it would be Death —<br><br>
And so I bear it big about<br>
My Burial — before<br>
A Life quite ready to depart<br>
Can harass me no more —</p>
