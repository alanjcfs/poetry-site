<p>We — Bee and I — live by the quaffing —<br>
'Tisn't all Hock — with us —<br>
Life has its Ale —<br>
But it's many a lay of the Dim Burgundy —<br>
We chant — for cheer — when the Wines — fail —<br><br>
Do we "get drunk"?<br>
Ask the jolly Clovers!<br>
Do we "beat" our "Wife"?<br>
I — never wed —<br>
Bee — pledges his — in minute flagons —<br>
Dainty — as the trees — on our deft Head —<br><br>
While runs the Rhine —<br>
He and I — revel —<br>
First — at the vat — and latest at the Vine —<br>
Noon — our last Cup —<br>
"Found dead" — "of Nectar" —<br>
By a humming Coroner —<br>
In a By-Thyme!</p>
