<p>A winged spark doth soar about —<br>
I never met it near<br>
For Lightning it is oft mistook<br>
When nights are hot and sere —<br><br>
Its twinkling Travels it pursues<br>
Above the Haunts of men —<br>
A speck of Rapture — first perceived<br>
By feeling it is gone —<br>
Rekindled by some action quaint</p>
