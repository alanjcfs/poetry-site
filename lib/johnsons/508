<p>I'm ceded — I've stopped being Theirs —<br>
The name They dropped upon my face<br>
With water, in the country church<br>
Is finished using, now,<br>
And They can put it with my Dolls,<br>
My childhood, and the string of spools,<br>
I've finished threading — too —<br><br>
Baptized, before, without the choice,<br>
But this time, consciously, of Grace —<br>
Unto supremest name —<br>
Called to my Full — The Crescent dropped —<br>
Existence's whole Arc, filled up,<br>
With one small Diadem.<br><br>
My second Rank — too small the first —<br>
Crowned — Crowing — on my Father's breast —<br>
A half unconscious Queen —<br>
But this time — Adequate — Erect,<br>
With Will to choose, or to reject,<br>
And I choose, just a Crown —</p>
