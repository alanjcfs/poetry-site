<p>I dreaded that first Robin, so,<br>
But He is mastered, now,<br>
I'm accustomed to Him grown,<br>
He hurts a little, though —<br><br>
I thought If I could only live<br>
Till that first Shout got by —<br>
Not all Pianos in the Woods<br>
Had power to mangle me —<br><br>
I dared not meet the Daffodils —<br>
For fear their Yellow Gown<br>
Would pierce me with a fashion<br>
So foreign to my own —<br><br>
I wished the Grass would hurry —<br>
So — when 'twas time to see —<br>
He'd be too tall, the tallest one<br>
Could stretch — to look at me —<br><br>
I could not bear the Bees should come,<br>
I wished they'd stay away<br>
In those dim countries where they go,<br>
What word had they, for me?<br><br>
They're here, though; not a creature failed —<br>
No Blossom stayed away<br>
In gentle deference to me —<br>
The Queen of Calvary —<br><br>
Each one salutes me, as he goes,<br>
And I, my childish Plumes,<br>
Lift, in bereaved acknowledgment<br>
Of their unthinking Drums —</p>
