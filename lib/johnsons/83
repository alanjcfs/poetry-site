<p>Heart, not so heavy as mine<br>
Wending late home —<br>
As it passed my window<br>
Whistled itself a tune —<br>
A careless snatch — a ballad — A ditty of the street —<br>
Yet to my irritated Ear<br>
An Anodyne so sweet —<br>
It was as if a Bobolink<br>
Sauntering this way<br>
Carolled, and paused, and carolled —<br>
Then bubbled slow away!<br>
It was as if a chirping brook<br>
Upon a dusty way —<br>
Set bleeding feet to minuets<br>
Without the knowing why!<br>
Tomorrow, night will come again —<br>
Perhaps, weary and sore —<br>
Ah Bugle! By my window<br>
I pray you pass once more.</p>
