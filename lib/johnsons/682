<p>'Twould ease — a Butterfly —<br>
Elate — a Bee —<br>
Thou'rt neither —<br>
Neither — thy capacity —<br><br>
But, Blossom, were I,<br>
I would rather be<br>
Thy moment<br>
Than a Bee's Eternity —<br><br>
Content of fading<br>
Is enough for me —<br>
Fade I unto Divinity —<br><br>
And Dying — Lifetime —<br>
Ample as the Eye —<br>
Her least attention raise on me —</p>
