<p>My Cocoon tightens — Colors tease —<br>
I'm feeling for the Air —<br>
A dim capacity for Wings<br>
Demeans the Dress I wear —<br><br>
A power of Butterfly must be —<br>
The Aptitude to fly<br>
Meadows of Majesty implies<br>
And easy Sweeps of Sky —<br><br>
So I must baffle at the Hint<br>
And cipher at the Sign<br>
And make much blunder, if at last<br>
I take the clue divine —</p>
