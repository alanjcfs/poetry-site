<p>The Grass so little has to do —<br>
A Sphere of simple Green —<br>
With only Butterflies to brood<br>
And Bees to entertain —<br><br>
And stir all day to pretty Tunes<br>
The Breezes fetch along —<br>
And hold the Sunshine in its lap<br>
And bow to everything —<br><br>
And thread the Dews, all night, like Pearls —<br>
And make itself so fine<br>
A Duchess were too common<br>
For such a noticing —<br><br>
And even when it dies — to pass<br>
In Odors so divine —<br>
Like Lowly spices, lain to sleep —<br>
Or Spikenards, perishing —<br><br>
And then, in Sovereign Barns to dwell —<br>
And dream the Days away,<br>
The Grass so little has to do<br>
I wish I were a Hay —</p>
