<p>So has a Daisy vanished<br>
From the fields today -<br>
So tiptoed many a slipper<br>
To Paradise away -<br>
Oozed so, in crimson bubbles<br>
Day's departing tide -<br>
Blooming - tripping - flowing -<br>
Are ye then with God?</p>

<p>So has a Daisy vanished<br>
From the fields today —<br>
So tiptoed many a slipper<br>
To Paradise away —<br><br>
Oozed so in crimson bubbles<br>
Day's departing tide —<br>
Blooming — tripping — flowing<br>
Are ye then with God?</p>
