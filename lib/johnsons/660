<p>'Tis good — the looking back on Grief —<br>
To re-endure a Day —<br>
We thought the Mighty Funeral —<br>
Of All Conceived Joy —<br><br>
To recollect how Busy Grass<br>
Did meddle — one by one —<br>
Till all the Grief with Summer — waved<br>
And none could see the stone.<br><br>
And though the Woe you have Today<br>
Be larger — As the Sea<br>
Exceeds its Unremembered Drop —<br>
They're Water — equally —</p>
