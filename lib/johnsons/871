<p>The Sun and Moon must make their haste —<br>
The Stars express around<br>
For in the Zones of Paradise<br>
The Lord alone is burned —<br><br>
His Eye, it is the East and West —<br>
The North and South when He<br>
Do concentrate His Countenance<br>
Like Glow Worms, flee away —<br><br>
Oh Poor and Far —<br>
Oh Hindred Eye<br>
That hunted for the Day —<br>
The Lord a Candle entertains<br>
Entirely for Thee —</p>
