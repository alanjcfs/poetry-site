<p>No man saw awe, nor to his house<br>
Admitted he a man<br>
Though by his awful residence<br>
Has human nature been.<br><br>
Not deeming of his dread abode<br>
Till laboring to flee<br>
A grasp on comprehension laid<br>
Detained vitality.<br><br>
Returning is a different route<br>
The Spirit could not show<br>
For breathing is the only work<br>
To be enacted now.<br><br>
"Am not consumed," old Moses wrote,<br>
"Yet saw him face to face" â€”<br>
That very physiognomy<br>
I am convinced was this.</p>
