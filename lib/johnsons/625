<p>'Twas a long Parting — but the time<br>
For Interview — had Come —<br>
Before the Judgment Seat of God —<br>
The last — and second time<br><br>
These Fleshless Lovers met —<br>
A Heaven in a Gaze —<br>
A Heaven of Heavens — the Privilege<br>
Of one another's Eyes —<br><br>
No Lifetime — on Them —<br>
Appareled as the new<br>
Unborn — except They had beheld —<br>
Born infiniter — now —<br><br>
Was Bridal — e'er like This?<br>
A Paradise — the Host —<br>
And Cherubim — and Seraphim —<br>
The unobtrusive Guest —</p>
