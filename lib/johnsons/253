<p>You see I cannot see — your lifetime —<br>
I must guess —<br>
How many times it ache for me — today — Confess —<br>
How many times for my far sake<br>
The brave eyes film —<br>
But I guess guessing hurts —<br>
Mine — got so dim!<br><br>
Too vague — the face —<br>
My own — so patient — covers —<br>
Too far — the strength —<br>
My timidness enfolds —<br>
Haunting the Heart —<br>
Like her translated faces —<br>
Teasing the want —<br>
It — only — can suffice!</p>
