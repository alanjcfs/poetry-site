<p>A wounded Deer — leaps highest —<br>
I’ve heard the Hunter tell —<br>
‘Tis but the Ecstasy of death —<br>
And then the Brake is still!<br><br>

The Smitten Rock that gushes!<br>
The trampled Steel that springs!<br>
A Cheek is always redder<br>
Just where the Hectic stings!<br><br>

Mirth is the Mail of Anguish<br>
In which it Cautious Arm,<br>
Lest anybody spy the blood<br>
And “you’re hurt” exclaim!</p>
