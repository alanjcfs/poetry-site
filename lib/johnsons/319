<p>The nearest Dream recedes — unrealized —<br>
The Heaven we chase,<br>
Like the June Bee — before the School Boy,<br>
Invites the Race —<br>
Stoops — to an easy Clover —<br>
Dips — evades — teases — deploys —<br>
Then — to the Royal Clouds<br>
Lifts his light Pinnace —<br>
Heedless of the Boy —<br>
Staring — bewildered — at the mocking sky —<br>
Homesick for steadfast Honey —<br>
Ah, the Bee flies not<br>
That brews that rare variety!</p>
