<p>A House upon the Height —<br>
That Wagon never reached —<br>
No Dead, were ever carried down —<br>
No Peddler's Cart — approached —<br><br>
Whose Chimney never smoked —<br>
Whose Windows — Night and Morn —<br>
Caught Sunrise first — and Sunset — last —<br>
Then — held an Empty Pane —<br><br>
Whose fate — Conjecture knew —<br>
No other neighbor — did —<br>
And what it was — we never lisped —<br>
Because He — never told —</p>
