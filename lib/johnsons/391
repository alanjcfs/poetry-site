<p>A Visitor in Marl —<br>
Who influences Flowers —<br>
Till they are orderly as Busts —<br>
And Elegant — as Glass —<br><br>
Who visits in the Night —<br>
And just before the Sun —<br>
Concludes his glistening interview —<br>
Caresses — and is gone —<br><br>
But whom his fingers touched —<br>
And where his feet have run —<br>
And whatsoever Mouth be kissed —<br>
Is as it had not been —</p>
