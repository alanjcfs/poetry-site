<p>Of Bronze — and Blaze —<br>
The North — Tonight —<br>
So adequate — it forms —<br>
So preconcerted with itself —<br>
So distant — to alarms —<br>
An Unconcern so sovereign<br>
To Universe, or me —<br>
Infects my simple spirit<br>
With Taints of Majesty —<br>
Till I take vaster attitudes —<br>
And strut upon my stem —<br>
Disdaining Men, and Oxygen,<br>
For Arrogance of them —<br>
<br>
My Splendors, are Menagerie —<br>
But their Competeless Show<br>
Will entertain the Centuries<br>
When I, am long ago,<br>
An Island in dishonored Grass —<br>
Whom none but Beetles — know.</p>
