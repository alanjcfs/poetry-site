<p>Good Morning — Midnight —<br>
I'm coming Home —<br>
Day — got tired of Me —<br>
How could I — of Him?<br>
<br>
Sunshine was a sweet place —<br>
I liked to stay —<br>
But Morn — didn't want me — now —<br>
So — Goodnight — Day!<br>
<br>
I can look — can't I —<br>
When the East is Red?<br>
The Hills — have a way — then —<br>
That puts the Heart — abroad —<br>
<br>
You — are not so fair — Midnight —<br>
I chose — Day —<br>
But — please take a little Girl —<br>
He turned away!</p>
