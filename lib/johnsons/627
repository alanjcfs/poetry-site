<p>The Tint I cannot take — is best —<br>
The Color too remote<br>
That I could show it in Bazaar —<br>
A Guinea at a sight —<br><br>
The fine — impalpable Array —<br>
That swaggers on the eye<br>
Like Cleopatra's Company —<br>
Repeated — in the sky —<br><br>
The Moments of Dominion<br>
That happen on the Soul<br>
And leave it with a Discontent<br>
Too exquisite — to tell —<br><br>
The eager look — on Landscapes —<br>
As if they just repressed<br>
Some Secret — that was pushing<br>
Like Chariots — in the Vest —<br><br>
The Pleading of the Summer —<br>
That other Prank — of Snow —<br>
That Cushions Mystery with Tulle,<br>
For fear the Squirrels — know.<br><br>
Their Graspless manners — mock us —<br>
Until the Cheated Eye<br>
Shuts arrogantly — in the Grave —<br>
Another way — to see —</p>
