<p>The Loneliness One dare not sound —<br>
And would as soon surmise<br>
As in its Grave go plumbing<br>
To ascertain the size —<br><br>
The Loneliness whose worst alarm<br>
Is lest itself should see —<br>
And perish from before itself<br>
For just a scrutiny —<br><br>
The Horror not to be surveyed —<br>
But skirted in the Dark —<br>
With Consciousness suspended —<br>
And Being under Lock —<br><br>
I fear me this — is Loneliness —<br>
The Maker of the soul<br>
Its Caverns and its Corridors<br>
Illuminate — or seal —</p>
