<p>Two Travellers perishing in Snow<br>
The Forests as they froze<br>
Together heard them strengthening<br>
Each other with the words<br><br>
That Heaven if Heaven — must contain<br>
What Either left behind<br>
And then the cheer too solemn grew<br>
For language, and the wind<br><br>
Long steps across the features took<br>
That Love had touched the Morn<br>
With reverential Hyacinth —<br>
The taleless Days went on<br><br>
Till Mystery impatient drew<br>
And those They left behind<br>
Led absent, were procured of Heaven<br>
As Those first furnished, said —</p>
