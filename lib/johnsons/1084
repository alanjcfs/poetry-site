<p>At Half past Three, a single Bird<br>
Unto a silent Sky<br>
Propounded but a single term<br>
Of cautious melody.<br><br>
At Half past Four, Experiment<br>
Had subjugated test<br>
And lo, Her silver Principle<br>
Supplanted all the rest.<br><br>
At Half past Seven, Element<br>
Nor Implement, be seen â€”<br>
And Place was where the Presence was<br>
Circumference between.</p>
