<p>Now I knew I lost her —<br>
Not that she was gone —<br>
But Remoteness travelled<br>
On her Face and Tongue.<br><br>
Alien, though adjoining<br>
As a Foreign Race —<br>
Traversed she though pausing<br>
Latitudeless Place.<br><br>
Elements Unaltered —<br>
Universe the same<br>
But Love's transmigration —<br>
Somehow this had come —<br><br>
Henceforth to remember<br>
Nature took the Day<br>
I had paid so much for —<br>
His is Penury<br>
Not who toils for Freedom<br>
Or for Family<br>
But the Restitution<br>
Of Idolatry.</p>
