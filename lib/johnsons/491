<p>While it is alive<br>
Until Death touches it<br>
While it and I lap one Air<br>
Dwell in one Blood<br>
Under one Sacrament<br>
Show me Division can split or pare —<br><br>
Love is like Life — merely longer<br>
Love is like Death, during the Grave<br>
Love is the Fellow of the Resurrection<br>
Scooping up the Dust and chanting "Live"!</p>
