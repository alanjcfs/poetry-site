<p>The Wind took up the Northern Things<br>
And piled them in the south —<br>
Then gave the East unto the West<br>
And opening his mouth<br><br>
The four Divisions of the Earth<br>
Did make as to devour<br>
While everything to corners slunk<br>
Behind the awful power —<br><br>
The Wind — unto his Chambers went<br>
And nature ventured out —<br>
Her subjects scattered into place<br>
Her systems ranged about<br><br>
Again the smoke from Dwellings rose<br>
The Day abroad was heard —<br>
How intimate, a Tempest past<br>
The Transport of the Bird —</p>
