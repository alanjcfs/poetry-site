<p>It troubled me as once I was —<br>
For I was once a Child —<br>
Concluding how an Atom — fell —<br>
And yet the Heavens — held —<br><br>
The Heavens weighed the most — by far —<br>
Yet Blue — and solid — stood —<br>
Without a Bolt — that I could prove —<br>
Would Giants — understand?<br><br>
Life set me larger — problems —<br>
Some I shall keep — to solve<br>
Till Algebra is easier —<br>
Or simpler proved — above —<br><br>
Then — too — be comprehended —<br>
What sorer — puzzled me —<br>
Why Heaven did not break away —<br>
And tumble — Blue — on me —</p>
