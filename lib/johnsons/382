<p>For Death — or rather<br>
For the Things 'twould buy —<br>
This — put away<br>
Life's Opportunity —<br><br>
The Things that Death will buy<br>
Are Room —<br>
Escape from Circumstances —<br>
And a Name —<br><br>
With Gifts of Life<br>
How Death's Gifts may compare —<br>
We know not —<br>
For the Rates — lie Here —</p>
