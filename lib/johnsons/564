<p>My period had come for Prayer —<br>
No other Art — would do —<br>
My Tactics missed a rudiment —<br>
Creator — Was it you?<br><br>
God grows above — so those who pray<br>
Horizons — must ascend —<br>
And so I stepped upon the North<br>
To see this Curious Friend —<br><br>
His House was not — no sign had He —<br>
By Chimney — nor by Door<br>
Could I infer his Residence —<br>
Vast Prairies of Air<br><br>
Unbroken by a Settler —<br>
Were all that I could see —<br>
Infinitude — Had'st Thou no Face<br>
That I might look on Thee?<br><br>
The Silence condescended —<br>
Creation stopped — for Me —<br>
But awed beyond my errand —<br>
I worshipped — did not "pray" —</p>
