<p>She sights a Bird — she chuckles —<br>
She flattens — then she crawls —<br>
She runs without the look of feet —<br>
Her eyes increase to Balls —<br><br>
Her Jaws stir — twitching — hungry —<br>
Her Teeth can hardly stand —<br>
She leaps, but Robin leaped the first —<br>
Ah, Pussy, of the Sand,<br><br>
The Hopes so juicy ripening —<br>
You almost bather your Tongue —<br>
When Bliss disclosed a hundred Toes —<br>
And fled with every one —</p>
