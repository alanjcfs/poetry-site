<p>How happy is the little Stone<br>
That rambles in the Road alone,<br>
And doesn't care about Careers<br>
And Exigencies never fears —<br>
Whose Coat of elemental Brown<br>
A passing Universe put on,<br>
And independent as the Sun<br>
Associates or glows alone,<br>
Fulfilling absolute Decree<br>
In casual simplicity —</p>
