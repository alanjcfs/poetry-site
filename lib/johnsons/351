<p>I felt my life with both my hands<br>
To see if it was there —<br>
I held my spirit to the Glass,<br>
To prove it possibler —<br><br>
I turned my Being round and round<br>
And paused at every pound<br>
To ask the Owner's name —<br>
For doubt, that I should know the Sound —<br><br>
I judged my features — jarred my hair —<br>
I pushed my dimples by, and waited —<br>
If they — twinkled back —<br>
Conviction might, of me —<br><br>
I told myself, "Take Courage, Friend —<br>
That — was a former time —<br>
But we might learn to like the Heaven,<br>
As well as our Old Home!"</p>
