<p>I would not paint — a picture —<br>
I'd rather be the One<br>
Its bright impossibility<br>
To dwell — delicious — on —<br>
And wonder how the fingers feel<br>
Whose rare — celestial — stir —<br>
Evokes so sweet a Torment —<br>
Such sumptuous — Despair —<br><br>
I would not talk, like Cornets —<br>
I'd rather be the One<br>
Raised softly to the Ceilings —<br>
And out, and easy on —<br>
Through Villages of Ether —<br>
Myself endued Balloon<br>
By but a lip of Metal —<br>
The pier to my Pontoon —<br><br>
Nor would I be a Poet —<br>
It's finer — own the Ear —<br>
Enamored — impotent — content —<br>
The License to revere,<br>
A privilege so awful<br>
What would the Dower be,<br>
Had I the Art to stun myself<br>
With Bolts of Melody!</p>
