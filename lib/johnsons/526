<p>To hear an Oriole sing<br>
May be a common thing —<br>
Or only a divine.<br><br>
It is not of the Bird<br>
Who sings the same, unheard,<br>
As unto Crowd —<br><br>
The Fashion of the Ear<br>
Attireth that it hear<br>
In Dun, or fair —<br><br>
So whether it be Rune,<br>
Or whether it be none<br>
Is of within.<br><br>
The "Tune is in the Tree —"<br>
The Skeptic — showeth me —<br>
"No Sir! In Thee!"</p>
