<p>Like eyes that looked on Wastes —<br>
Incredulous of Ought<br>
But Blank — and steady Wilderness —<br>
Diversified by Night —<br>
<br>
Just Infinites of Nought —<br>
As far as it could see —<br>
So looked the face I looked upon —<br>
So looked itself — on Me —<br>
<br>
I offered it no Help —<br>
Because the Cause was Mine —<br>
The Misery a Compact<br>
As hopeless — as divine —<br>
<br>
Neither — would be absolved —<br>
Neither would be a Queen<br>
Without the Other — Therefore —<br>
We perish — tho' We reign —</p>
