<p>We learned the Whole of Love —<br>
The Alphabet — the Words —<br>
A Chapter — then the mighty Book —<br>
Then — Revelation closed —<br><br>
But in Each Other's eyes<br>
An Ignorance beheld —<br>
Diviner than the Childhood's —<br>
And each to each, a Child —<br><br>
Attempted to expound<br>
What Neither — understood —<br>
Alas, that Wisdom is so large —<br>
And Truth — so manifold!</p>
