<p>There is a Languor of the Life<br>
More imminent than Pain —<br>
'Tis Pain's Successor — When the Soul<br>
Has suffered all it can —<br><br>
A Drowsiness — diffuses —<br>
A Dimness like a Fog<br>
Envelops Consciousness —<br>
As Mists — obliterate a Crag.<br><br>
The Surgeon — does not blanch — at pain<br>
His Habit — is severe —<br>
But tell him that it ceased to feel —<br>
The Creature lying there —<br><br>
And he will tell you — skill is late —<br>
A Mightier than He —<br>
Has ministered before Him —<br>
There's no Vitality.</p>
