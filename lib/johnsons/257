<p>Delight is as the flight —<br>
Or in the Ratio of it,<br>
As the Schools would say —<br>
The Rainbow's way —<br>
A Skein<br>
Flung colored, after Rain,<br>
Would suit as bright,<br>
Except that flight<br>
Were Aliment —<br>
<br>
"If it would last"<br>
I asked the East,<br>
When that Bent Stripe<br>
Struck up my childish<br>
Firmament —<br>
And I, for glee,<br>
Took Rainbows, as the common way,<br>
And empty Skies<br>
The Eccentricity —<br>
<br>
And so with Lives —<br>
And so with Butterflies —<br>
Seen magic — through the fright<br>
That they will cheat the sight —<br>
And Dower latitudes far on —<br>
Some sudden morn —<br>
Our portion — in the fashion —<br>
Done —</p>
