<p>Because the Bee may blameless hum<br>
For Thee a Bee do I become<br>
List even unto Me.<br>
<br>
Because the Flowers unafraid<br>
May lift a look on thine, a Maid<br>
Alway a Flower would be.<br>
<br>
Nor Robins, Robins need not hide<br>
When Thou upon their Crypts intrude<br>
So Wings bestow on Me<br>
Or Petals, or a Dower of Buzz<br>
That Bee to ride, or Flower of Furze<br>
I that way worship Thee.</p>
