<p>On a Columnar Self —<br>
How ample to rely<br>
In Tumult — or Extremity —<br>
How good the Certainty<br><br>
That Lever cannot pry —<br>
And Wedge cannot divide<br>
Conviction — That Granitic Base —<br>
Though None be on our Side —<br><br>
Suffice Us — for a Crowd —<br>
Ourself — and Rectitude —<br>
And that Assembly — not far off<br>
From furthest Spirit — God —</p>
