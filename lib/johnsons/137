<p>Flowers — Well — if anybody<br>
Can the ecstasy define —<br>
Half a transport — half a trouble —<br>
With which flowers humble men:<br>
Anybody find the fountain<br>
From which floods so contra flow —<br>
I will give him all the Daisies<br>
Which upon the hillside blow.<br><br>
Too much pathos in their faces<br>
For a simple breast like mine —<br>
Butterflies from St. Domingo<br>
Cruising round the purple line —<br>
Have a system of aesthetics —<br>
Far superior to mine.</p>
