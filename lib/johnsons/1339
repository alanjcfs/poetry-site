<p>A Bee his burnished Carriage<br>
Drove boldly to a Rose —<br>
Combinedly alighting —<br>
Himself — his Carriage was —<br>
The Rose received his visit<br>
With frank tranquillity<br>
Withholding not a Crescent<br>
To his Cupidity —<br>
Their Moment consummated —<br>
Remained for him — to flee —<br>
Remained for her — of rapture<br>
But the humility.</p>
