<p>We do not play on Graves —<br>
Because there isn't Room —<br>
Besides — it isn't even — it slants<br>
And People come —<br><br>
And put a Flower on it —<br>
And hang their faces so —<br>
We're fearing that their Hearts will drop —<br>
And crush our pretty play —<br><br>
And so we move as far<br>
As Enemies — away —<br>
Just looking round to see how far<br>
It is — Occasionally —</p>
