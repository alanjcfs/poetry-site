<p>My first well Day — since many ill —<br>
I asked to go abroad,<br>
And take the Sunshine in my hands,<br>
And see the things in Pod —<br><br>
A 'blossom just when I went in<br>
To take my Chance with pain —<br>
Uncertain if myself, or He,<br>
Should prove the strongest One.<br><br>
The Summer deepened, while we strove —<br>
She put some flowers away —<br>
And Redder cheeked Ones — in their stead —<br>
A fond — illusive way —<br><br>
To cheat Herself, it seemed she tried —<br>
As if before a child<br>
To fade — Tomorrow — Rainbows held<br>
The Sepulchre, could hide.<br><br>
She dealt a fashion to the Nut —<br>
She tied the Hoods to Seeds —<br>
She dropped bright scraps of Tint, about —<br>
And left Brazilian Threads<br><br>
On every shoulder that she met —<br>
Then both her Hands of Haze<br>
Put up — to hide her parting Grace<br>
From our unfitted eyes.<br><br>
My loss, by sickness — Was it Loss?<br>
Or that Ethereal Gain<br>
One earns by measuring the Grave —<br>
Then — measuring the Sun —</p>
