<p>Put up my lute!<br>
What of — my Music!<br>
Since the sole ear I cared to charm —<br>
Passive — as Granite — laps My Music —<br>
Sobbing — will suit — as well as psalm!<br><br>
Would but the "Memnon" of the Desert —<br>
Teach me the strain<br>
That vanquished Him —<br>
When He — surrendered to the Sunrise —<br>
Maybe — that — would awaken — them!</p>
