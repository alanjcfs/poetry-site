<p>So large my Will<br>
The little that I may<br>
Embarrasses<br>
Like gentle infamy —<br><br>
Affront to Him<br>
For whom the Whole were small<br>
Affront to me<br>
Who know His Meed of all.<br><br>
Earth at the best<br>
Is but a scanty Toy —<br>
Bought, carried Home<br>
To Immortality.<br><br>
It looks so small<br>
We chiefly wonder then<br>
At our Conceit<br>
In purchasing.</p>
