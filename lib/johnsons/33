<p><i>Oh</i> if remembering were forgetting -<br>
Then I remember not!<br>
And if forgetting - recollecting -<br>
How near I had forgot!<br>
And if to miss - were merry -<br>
And to mourn were gay,<br>
How very blithe the maiden<br>
Who gathered these today!</p>

<p>If recollecting were forgetting,<br>
Then I remember not,<br>
And if forgetting, recollecting,<br>
How near I had forgot,<br>
And if to miss, were merry,<br>
And to mourn, were gay,<br>
How very blithe the fingers<br>
That gathered this, today!</p>

<p>If recollecting is forgetting,<br>
then I remember yet.<br>
And if forgetting, recollecting,<br>
how near I shall forget.<br>
And if to miss, were merry,<br>
and to mourn, were gay,<br>
how very blithe the fingers<br>
that gather this today</p>
