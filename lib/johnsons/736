<p>Have any like Myself<br>
Investigating March,<br>
New Houses on the Hill descried —<br>
And possibly a Church —<br><br>
That were not, We are sure —<br>
As lately as the Snow —<br>
And are Today — if We exist —<br>
Though how may this be so?<br><br>
Have any like Myself<br>
Conjectured Who may be<br>
The Occupants of the Adobes —<br>
So easy to the Sky —<br><br>
'Twould seem that God should be<br>
The nearest Neighbor to —<br>
And Heaven — a convenient Grace<br>
For Show, or Company —<br><br>
Have any like Myself<br>
Preserved the Charm secure<br>
By shunning carefully the Place<br>
All Seasons of the Year,<br><br>
Excepting March — 'Tis then<br>
My Villages be seen —<br>
And possibly a Steeple —<br>
Not afterward — by Men —</p>
