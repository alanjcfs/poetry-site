<p>Proud of my broken heart, since thou didst break it,<br>
Proud of the pain I did not feel till thee,<br><br>
Proud of my night, since thou with moons dost slake it,<br>
Not to partake thy passion, my humility.<br><br>
Thou can'st not boast, like Jesus, drunken without companion<br>
Was the strong cup of anguish brewed for the Nazarene<br><br>
Thou can'st not pierce tradition with the peerless puncture,<br>
See! I usurped thy crucifix to honor mine!</p>
