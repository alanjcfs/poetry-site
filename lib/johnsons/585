<p>I like to see it lap the Miles —<br>
And lick the Valleys up —<br>
And stop to feed itself at Tanks —<br>
And then — prodigious step<br><br>
Around a Pile of Mountains —<br>
And supercilious peer<br>
In Shanties — by the sides of Roads —<br>
And then a Quarry pare<br><br>
To fit its Ribs<br>
And crawl between<br>
Complaining all the while<br>
In horrid — hooting stanza —<br>
Then chase itself down Hill —<br><br>
And neigh like Boanerges —<br>
Then — punctual as a Star<br>
Stop — docile and omnipotent<br>
At its own stable door —</p>
