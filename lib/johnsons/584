<p>It ceased to hurt me, though so slow<br>
I could not feel the Anguish go —<br>
But only knew by looking back —<br>
That something — had benumbed the Track —<br><br>
Nor when it altered, I could say,<br>
For I had worn it, every day,<br>
As constant as the Childish frock —<br>
I hung upon the Peg, at night.<br><br>
But not the Grief — that nestled close<br>
As needles — ladies softly press<br>
To Cushions Cheeks —<br>
To keep their place —<br><br>
Nor what consoled it, I could trace —<br>
Except, whereas 'twas Wilderness —<br>
It's better — almost Peace —</p>
