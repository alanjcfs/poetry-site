<p>Just so — Jesus — raps —<br>
He — doesn't weary —<br>
Last — at the Knocker —<br>
And first — at the Bell.<br>
Then — on divinest tiptoe — standing —<br>
Might He but spy the lady's soul —<br>
When He — retires —<br>
Chilled — or weary —<br>
It will be ample time for — me —<br>
Patient — upon the steps — until then —<br>
Hears! I am knocking — low at thee.</p>
