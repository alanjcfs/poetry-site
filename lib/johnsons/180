<p>As if some little Arctic flower<br>
Upon the polar hem —<br>
Went wandering down the Latitudes<br>
Until it puzzled came<br>
To continents of summer —<br>
To firmaments of sun —<br>
To strange, bright crowds of flowers —<br>
And birds, of foreign tongue!<br>
I say, As if this little flower<br>
To Eden, wandered in —<br>
What then? Why nothing,<br>
Only, your inference therefrom!</p>
