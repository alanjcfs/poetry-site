<p>Tho' I get home how late — how late —<br>
So I get home - 'twill compensate —<br>
Better will be the Ecstasy<br>
That they have done expecting me —<br>
When Night — descending — dumb — and dark —<br>
They hear my unexpected knock —<br>
Transporting must the moment be —<br>
Brewed from decades of Agony!<br><br>
To think just how the fire will burn —<br>
Just how long-cheated eyes will turn —<br>
To wonder what myself will say,<br>
And what itself, will say to me —<br>
Beguiles the Centuries of way!</p>
