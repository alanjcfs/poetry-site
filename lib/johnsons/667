<p>Bloom upon the Mountain — stated —<br>
Blameless of a Name —<br>
Efflorescence of a Sunset —<br>
Reproduced — the same —<br>
<br>
Seed, had I, my Purple Sowing<br>
Should endow the Day —<br>
Not a Topic of a Twilight —<br>
Show itself away —<br>
<br>
Who for tilling — to the Mountain<br>
Come, and disappear —<br>
Whose be Her Renown, or fading,<br>
Witness, is not here —<br>
<br>
While I state — the Solemn Petals,<br>
Far as North — and East,<br>
Far as South and West — expanding —<br>
Culminate — in Rest —<br>
<br>
And the Mountain to the Evening<br>
Fit His Countenance —<br>
Indicating, by no Muscle —<br>
The Experience —</p>
