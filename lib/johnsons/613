<p>They shut me up in Prose —<br>
As when a little Girl<br>
They put me in the Closet —<br>
Because they liked me "still" —<br><br>
Still! Could themself have peeped —<br>
And seen my Brain — go round —<br>
They might as wise have lodged a Bird<br>
For Treason — in the Pound —<br><br>
Himself has but to will<br>
And easy as a Star<br>
Abolish his Captivity —<br>
And laugh — No more have I —</p>
