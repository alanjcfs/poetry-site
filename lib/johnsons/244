<p>It is easy to work when the soul is at play —<br>
But when the soul is in pain —<br>
The hearing him put his playthings up<br>
Makes work difficult — then —<br>
<br>
It is simple, to ache in the Bone, or the Rind —<br>
But Gimlets — among the nerve —<br>
Mangle daintier — terribler —<br>
Like a Panter in the Glove —</p>
