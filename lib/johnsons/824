<p>The Wind begun to knead the Grass —<br>
As Women do a Dough —<br>
He flung a Hand full at the Plain —<br>
A Hand full at the Sky —<br>
The Leaves unhooked themselves from Trees —<br>
And started all abroad —<br>
The Dust did scoop itself like Hands —<br>
And throw away the Road —<br>
The Wagons — quickened on the Street —<br>
The Thunders gossiped low —<br>
The Lightning showed a Yellow Head —<br>
And then a livid Toe —<br>
The Birds put up the Bars to Nests —<br>
The Cattle flung to Barns —<br>
Then came one drop of Giant Rain —<br>
And then, as if the Hands<br>
That held the Dams — had parted hold —<br>
The Waters Wrecked the Sky —<br>
But overlooked my Father's House —<br>
Just Quartering a Tree —</p>
