<p>As the Starved Maelstrom laps the Navies<br>
As the Vulture teased<br>
Forces the Broods in lonely Valleys<br>
As the Tiger eased<br><br>
By but a Crumb of Blood, fasts Scarlet<br>
Till he meet a Man<br>
Dainty adorned with Veins and Tissues<br>
And partakes — his Tongue<br><br>
Cooled by the Morsel for a moment<br>
Grows a fiercer thing<br>
Till he esteem his Dates and Cocoa<br>
A Nutrition mean<br><br>
I, of a finer Famine<br>
Deem my Supper dry<br>
For but a Berry of Domingo<br>
And a Torrid Eye —</p>
