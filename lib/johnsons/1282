<p>Art thou the thing I wanted?<br>
Begone — my Tooth has grown —<br>
Supply the minor Palate<br>
That has not starved so long —<br>
I tell thee while I waited<br>
The mystery of Food<br>
Increased till I abjured it<br>
And dine without Like God —<br><br>
—<br><br>
Art thou the thing I wanted?<br>
Begone — my Tooth has grown —<br>
Affront a minor palate<br>
Thou could'st not goad so long —<br><br>
I tell thee while I waited —<br>
The mystery of Food<br>
Increased till I abjured it<br>
Subsisting now like God —</p>
