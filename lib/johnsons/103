<p>I have a King, who does not speak —<br>
So — wondering — thro' the hours meek<br>
I trudge the day away —<br>
Half glad when it is night, and sleep,<br>
If, haply, thro' a dream, to peep<br>
In parlors, shut by day.<br>
<br>
And if I do — when morning comes —<br>
It is as if a hundred drums<br>
Did round my pillow roll,<br>
And shouts fill all my Childish sky,<br>
And Bells keep saying "Victory"<br>
From steeples in my soul!<br>
<br>
And if I don't — the little Bird<br>
Within the Orchard, is not heard,<br>
And I omit to pray<br>
"Father, thy will be done" today<br>
For my will goes the other way,<br>
And it were perjury!</p>
