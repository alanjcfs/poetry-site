<p>"Arcturus" is his other name —<br>
I'd rather call him "Star."<br>
It's very mean of Science<br>
To go and interfere!<br><br>
I slew a worm the other day —<br>
A "Savant" passing by<br>
Murmured "Resurgam" — "Centipede"!<br>
"Oh Lord — how frail are we"!<br><br>
I pull a flower from the woods —<br>
A monster with a glass<br>
Computes the stamens in a breath —<br>
And has her in a "class"!<br><br>
Whereas I took the Butterfly<br>
Aforetime in my hat —<br>
He sits erect in "Cabinets" —<br>
The Clover bells forgot.<br><br>
What once was "Heaven" Is "Zenith" now —<br>
Where I proposed to go<br>
When Time's brief masquerade was done<br>
Is mapped and charted too.<br><br>
What if the poles should frisk about<br>
And stand upon their heads!<br>
I hope I'm ready for "the worst" —<br>
Whatever prank betides!<br><br>
Perhaps the "Kingdom of Heaven's" changed —<br>
I hope the "Children" there<br>
Won't be "new fashioned" when I come —<br>
And laugh at me — and stare —<br><br>
I hope the Father in the skies<br>
Will lift his little girl —<br>
Old fashioned — naught — everything —<br>
Over the stile of "Pearl."</p>
