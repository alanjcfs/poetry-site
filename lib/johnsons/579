<p>I had been hungry, all the Years —<br>
My Noon had Come — to dine —<br>
I trembling drew the Table near —<br>
And touched the Curious Wine —<br><br>
'Twas this on Tables I had seen —<br>
When turning, hungry, Lone<br>
I looked in Windows, for the Wealth<br>
I could not hope — to Own —<br><br>
I did not know the ample Bread —<br>
'Twas so unlike the Crumb<br>
The Birds and I, had often shared<br>
In Nature's — Dining Room —<br><br>
The Plenty hurt me — 'twas so new —<br>
Myself felt ill — and odd —<br>
As Berry — of a Mountain Bush —<br>
Transplanted — to a Road —<br><br>
Nor was I hungry — so I found<br>
That Hunger — was a way<br>
Of Persons outside Windows —<br>
The Entering — takes away —</p>
