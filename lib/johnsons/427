<p>I'll clutch — and clutch —<br>
Next — One — Might be the golden touch —<br>
Could take it —<br>
Diamonds — Wait —<br>
I'm diving — just a little late —<br>
But stars — go slow — for night —<br>
<br>
I'll string you — in fine Necklace —<br>
Tiaras — make — of some —<br>
Wear you on Hem —<br>
Loop up a Countess — with you —<br>
Make — a Diadem — and mend my old One —<br>
Count — Hoard — then lose —<br>
And doubt that you are mine —<br>
To have the joy of feeling it — again —<br>
<br>
I'll show you at the Court —<br>
Bear you — for Ornament<br>
Where Women breathe —<br>
That every sigh — may lift you<br>
Just as high — as I —<br>
<br>
And — when I die —<br>
In meek array — display you —<br>
Still to show — how rich I go —<br>
Lest Skies impeach a wealth so wonderful —<br>
And banish me —</p>
