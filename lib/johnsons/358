<p>If any sink, assure that this, now standing —<br>
Failed like Themselves — and conscious that it rose —<br>
Grew by the Fact, and not the Understanding<br>
How Weakness passed — or Force — arose —<br>
<br>
Tell that the Worst, is easy in a Moment —<br>
Dread, but the Whizzing, before the Ball —<br>
When the Ball enters, enters Silence —<br>
Dying — annuls the power to kill.</p>
