<p>A fuzzy fellow, without feet,<br>
Yet doth exceeding run!<br>
Of velvet, is his Countenance,<br>
And his Complexion, dun!<br><br>
Sometime, he dwelleth in the grass!<br>
Sometime, upon a bough,<br>
From which he doth descend in plush<br>
Upon the Passer-by!<br><br>
All this in summer.<br>
But when winds alarm the Forest Folk,<br>
He taketh Damask Residence â€”<br>
And struts in sewing silk!<br><br>
Then, finer than a Lady,<br>
Emerges in the spring!<br>
A Feather on each shoulder!<br>
You'd scarce recognize him!<br><br>
By Men, yclept Caterpillar!<br>
By me! But who am I,<br>
To tell the pretty secret<br>
Of the Butterfly!</p>
