<p>The Props assist the House<br>
Until the House is built<br>
And then the Props withdraw<br>
And adequate, erect,<br>
The House support itself<br>
And cease to recollect<br>
The Auger and the Carpenter —<br>
Just such a retrospect<br>
Hath the perfected Life —<br>
A past of Plank and Nail<br>
And slowness — then the Scaffolds drop<br>
Affirming it a Soul.</p>
