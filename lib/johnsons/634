<p>You'll know Her — by Her Foot —<br>
The smallest Gamboge Hand<br>
With Fingers — where the Toes should be —<br>
Would more affront the Sand —<br><br>
Than this Quaint Creature's Boot —<br>
Adjusted by a Stern —<br>
Without a Button — I could vouch —<br>
Unto a Velvet Limb —<br><br>
You'll know Her — by Her Vest —<br>
Tight fitting — Orange — Brown —<br>
Inside a Jacket duller —<br>
She wore when she was born —<br><br>
Her Cap is small — and snug —<br>
Constructed for the Winds —<br>
She'd pass for Barehead — short way off —<br>
But as She Closer stands —<br><br>
So finer 'tis than Wool —<br>
You cannot feel the Seam —<br>
Nor is it Clasped unto of Band —<br>
Nor held upon — of Brim —<br><br>
You'll know Her — by Her Voice —<br>
At first — a doubtful Tone —<br>
A sweet endeavor — but as March<br>
To April — hurries on —<br><br>
She squanders on your Ear<br>
Such Arguments of Pearl —<br>
You beg the Robin in your Brain<br>
To keep the other — still —</p>
