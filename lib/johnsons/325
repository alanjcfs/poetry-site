<p>Of Tribulation, these are They,<br>
Denoted by the White —<br>
The Spangled Gowns, a lesser Rank<br>
Of Victors — designate —<br>
<br>
All these — did conquer —<br>
But the ones who overcame most times —<br>
Wear nothing commoner than Snow —<br>
No Ornament, but Palms —<br>
<br>
Surrender — is a sort unknown —<br>
On this superior soil —<br>
Defeat — an outgrown Anguish —<br>
Remembered, as the Mile<br>
<br>
Our panting Ankle barely passed —<br>
When Night devoured the Road —<br>
But we — stood whispering in the House —<br>
And all we said — was "Saved"!</p>
