<p>That I did always love<br>
I bring thee Proof<br>
That till I loved<br>
I never lived — Enough —<br><br>
That I shall love alway —<br>
I argue thee<br>
That love is life —<br>
And life hath Immortality —<br><br>
This — dost thou doubt — Sweet —<br>
Then have I<br>
Nothing to show<br>
But Calvary —</p>
