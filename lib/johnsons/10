<p>My Wheel is in the dark.<br>
I cannot see a spoke -<br>
Yet know it's dripping feet<br>
Go round and round.<br><br>
My foot is on the tide -<br>
An unfrequented road<br>
Yet have all roads<br>
A "Clearing" at the end.<br><br>
Some have resigned the Loom -<br>
Some - in the busy tomb<br>
Find quaint employ.<br>
Some with new - stately feet<br>
Pass royal thro' the gate<br>
Flinging the problem back, at you and I.</p>

<p>My wheel is in the dark!<br>
I cannot see a spoke<br>
Yet know its dripping feet<br>
Go round and round.<br><br>
My foot is on the Tide!<br>
An unfrequented road —<br>
Yet have all roads<br>
A clearing at the end —<br><br>
Some have resigned the Loom —<br>
Some in the busy tomb<br>
Find quaint employ —<br><br>
Some with new — stately feet —<br>
Pass royal through the gate —<br>
Flinging the problem back<br>
At you and I!</p>
