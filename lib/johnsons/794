<p>A Drop Fell on the Apple Tree —<br>
Another — on the Roof —<br>
A Half a Dozen kissed the Eaves —<br>
And made the Gables laugh —<br><br>
A few went out to help the Brook<br>
That went to help the Sea —<br>
Myself Conjectured were they Pearls —<br>
What Necklace could be —<br><br>
The Dust replaced, in Hoisted Roads —<br>
The Birds jocoser sung —<br>
The Sunshine threw his Hat away —<br>
The Bushes — spangles flung —<br><br>
The Breezes brought dejected Lutes —<br>
And bathed them in the Glee —<br>
Then Orient showed a single Flag,<br>
And signed the Fete away —</p>
