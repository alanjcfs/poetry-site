<p>We see — Comparatively —<br>
The Thing so towering high<br>
We could not grasp its segment<br>
Unaided — Yesterday —<br><br>
This Morning's finer Verdict —<br>
Makes scarcely worth the toil —<br>
A furrow — Our Cordillera —<br>
Our Apennine — a Knoll —<br><br>
Perhaps 'tis kindly — done us —<br>
The Anguish — and the loss —<br>
The wrenching — for His Firmament<br>
The Thing belonged to us —<br><br>
To spare these Striding Spirits<br>
Some Morning of Chagrin —<br>
The waking in a Gnat's — embrace —<br>
Our Giants — further on —</p>
