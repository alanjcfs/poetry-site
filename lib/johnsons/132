<p>I bring an unaccustomed wine<br>
To lips long parching<br>
Next to mine,<br>
And summon them to drink;<br><br>
Crackling with fever, they Essay,<br>
I turn my brimming eyes away,<br>
And come next hour to look.<br><br>
The hands still hug the tardy glass —<br>
The lips I would have cooled, alas —<br>
Are so superfluous Cold —<br><br>
I would as soon attempt to warm<br>
The bosoms where the frost has lain<br>
Ages beneath the mould —<br><br>
Some other thirsty there may be<br>
To whom this would have pointed me<br>
Had it remained to speak —<br><br>
And so I always bear the cup<br>
If, haply, mine may be the drop<br>
Some pilgrim thirst to slake —<br><br>
If, haply, any say to me<br>
"Unto the little, unto me,"<br>
When I at last awake.</p>
