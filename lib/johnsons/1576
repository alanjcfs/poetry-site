<p>The Spirit lasts — but in what mode —<br>
Below, the Body speaks,<br>
But as the Spirit furnishes —<br>
Apart, it never talks —<br>
The Music in the Violin<br>
Does not emerge alone<br>
But Arm in Arm with Touch, yet Touch<br>
Alone — is not a Tune —<br>
The Spirit lurks within the Flesh<br>
Like Tides within the Sea<br>
That make the Water live, estranged<br>
What would the Either be?<br>
Does that know — now — or does it cease —<br>
That which to this is done,<br>
Resuming at a mutual date<br>
With every future one?<br>
Instinct pursues the Adamant,<br>
Exacting this Reply —<br>
Adversity if it may be, or<br>
Wild Prosperity,<br>
The Rumor's Gate was shut so tight<br>
Before my Mind was sown,<br>
Not even a Prognostic's Push<br>
Could make a Dent thereon —</p>
