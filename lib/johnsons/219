<p>She sweeps with many-colored Brooms —<br>
And leaves the Shreds behind —<br>
Oh Housewife in the Evening West —<br>
Come back, and dust the Pond!<br><br>
You dropped a Purple Ravelling in —<br>
You dropped an Amber thread —<br>
And how you've littered all the East<br>
With duds of Emerald!<br><br>
And still, she plies her spotted Brooms,<br>
And still the Aprons fly,<br>
Till Brooms fade softly into stars —<br>
And then I come away —</p>
