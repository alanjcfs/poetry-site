<p>The Way I read a Letter's — this —<br>
'Tis first — I lock the Door —<br>
And push it with my fingers — next —<br>
For transport it be sure —<br><br>
And then I go the furthest off<br>
To counteract a knock —<br>
Then draw my little Letter forth<br>
And slowly pick the lock —<br><br>
Then — glancing narrow, at the Wall —<br>
And narrow at the floor<br>
For firm Conviction of a Mouse<br>
Not exorcised before —<br><br>
Peruse how infinite I am<br>
To no one that You — know —<br>
And sigh for lack of Heaven — but not<br>
The Heaven God bestow —</p>
