<p>Those fair — fictitious People —<br>
The Women — plucked away<br>
From our familiar Lifetime —<br>
The Men of Ivory —<br><br>
Those Boys and Girls, in Canvas —<br>
Who stay upon the Wall<br>
In Everlasting Keepsake —<br>
Can Anybody tell?<br><br>
We trust — in places perfecter —<br>
Inheriting Delight<br>
Beyond our faint Conjecture —<br>
Our dizzy Estimate —<br><br>
Remembering ourselves, we trust —<br>
Yet Blesseder — than We —<br>
Through Knowing — where We only hope —<br>
Receiving — where we — pray —<br><br>
Of Expectation — also —<br>
Anticipating us<br>
With transport, that would be a pain<br>
Except for Holiness —<br><br>
Esteeming us — as Exile —<br>
Themself — admitted Home —<br>
Through easy Miracle of Death —<br>
The Way ourself, must come —</p>
