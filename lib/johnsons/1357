<p>"Faithful to the end" Amended<br>
From the Heavenly Clause —<br>
Constancy with a Proviso<br>
Constancy abhors —<br>
<br>
"Crowns of Life" are servile Prizes<br>
To the stately Heart,<br>
Given for the Giving, solely,<br>
No Emolument.<br>

"Faithful to the end" Amended<br>
From the Heavenly clause —<br>
Lucrative indeed the offer<br>
But the Heart withdraws —<br>
<br>
"I will give" the base Proviso —<br>
Spare Your "Crown of Life" —<br>
Those it fits, too fair to wear it —<br>
Try it on Yourself —</p>
