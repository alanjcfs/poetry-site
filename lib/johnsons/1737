<p>Rearrange a "Wife's" affection!<br>
When they dislocate my Brain!<br>
Amputate my freckled Bosom!<br>
Make me bearded like a man!<br><br>
Blush, my spirit, in thy Fastness —<br>
Blush, my unacknowledged clay —<br>
Seven years of troth have taught thee<br>
More than Wifehood every may!<br><br>
Love that never leaped its socket —<br>
Trust entrenched in narrow pain —<br>
Constancy thro' fire — awarded —<br>
Anguish — bare of anodyne!<br><br>
Burden — borne so far triumphant —<br>
None suspect me of the crown,<br>
For I wear the "Thorns" till Sunset —<br>
Then — my Diadem put on.<br><br>
Big my Secret but it's bandaged —<br>
It will never get away<br>
Till the Day its Weary Keeper<br>
Leads it through the Grave to thee.</p>
