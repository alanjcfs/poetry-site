<p>I could suffice for Him, I knew —<br>
He — could suffice for Me —<br>
Yet Hesitating Fractions — Both<br>
Surveyed Infinity —<br><br>
"Would I be Whole" He sudden broached —<br>
My syllable rebelled —<br>
'Twas face to face with Nature — forced —<br>
'Twas face to face with God —<br><br>
Withdrew the Sun — to Other Wests —<br>
Withdrew the furthest Star<br>
Before Decision — stooped to speech —<br>
And then — be audibler<br><br>
The Answer of the Sea unto<br>
The Motion of the Moon —<br>
Herself adjust Her Tides — unto —<br>
Could I — do else — with Mine?</p>
