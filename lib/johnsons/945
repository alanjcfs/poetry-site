<p>This is a Blossom of the Brain —<br>
A small — italic Seed<br>
Lodged by Design or Happening<br>
The Spirit fructified —<br><br>
Shy as the Wind of his Chambers<br>
Swift as a Freshet's Tongue<br>
So of the Flower of the Soul<br>
Its process is unknown.<br><br>
When it is found, a few rejoice<br>
The Wise convey it Home<br>
Carefully cherishing the spot<br>
If other Flower become.<br><br>
When it is lost, that Day shall be<br>
The Funeral of God,<br>
Upon his Breast, a closing Soul<br>
The Flower of our Lord.</p>
