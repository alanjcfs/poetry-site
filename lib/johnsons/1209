<p>To disappear enhances —<br>
The Man that runs away<br>
Is tinctured for an instant<br>
With Immortality<br><br>
But yesterday a Vagrant —<br>
Today in Memory lain<br>
With superstitious value<br>
We tamper with "Again"<br><br>
But "Never" far as Honor<br>
Withdraws the Worthless thing<br>
And impotent to cherish<br>
We hasten to adorn —<br><br>
Of Death the sternest function<br>
That just as we discern<br>
The Excellence defies us —<br>
Securest gathered then<br><br>
The Fruit perverse to plucking,<br>
But leaning to the Sight<br>
With the ecstatic limit<br>
Of unobtained Delight —</p>
