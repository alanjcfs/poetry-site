<p>A Word made Flesh is seldom<br>
And tremblingly partook<br>
Nor then perhaps reported<br>
But have I not mistook<br>
Each one of us has tasted<br>
With ecstasies of stealth<br>
The very food debated<br>
To our specific strength —<br><br>
A Word that breathes distinctly<br>
Has not the power to die<br>
Cohesive as the Spirit<br>
It may expire if He —<br>
"Made Flesh and dwelt among us"<br>
Could condescension be<br>
Like this consent of Language<br>
This loved Philology.</p>
