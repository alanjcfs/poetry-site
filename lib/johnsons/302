<p>Like Some Old fashioned Miracle<br>
When Summertime is done —<br>
Seems Summer's Recollection<br>
And the Affairs of June<br><br>
As infinite Tradition<br>
As Cinderella's Bays —<br>
Or Little John — of Lincoln Green —<br>
Or Blue Beard's Galleries —<br><br>
Her Bees have a fictitious Hum —<br>
Her Blossoms, like a Dream —<br>
Elate us — till we almost weep —<br>
So plausible — they seem —<br><br>
Her Memories like Strains — Review —<br>
When Orchestra is dumb —<br>
The Violin in Baize replaced —<br>
And Ear — and Heaven — numb —</p>
