<p>A little bread — a crust — a crumb —<br>
A little trust — a demijohn —<br>
Can keep the soul alive —<br>
Not portly, mind! but breathing — warm —<br>
Conscious — as old Napoleon,<br>
The night before the Crown!<br><br>
A modest lot — A fame petite —<br>
A brief Campaign of sting and sweet<br>
Is plenty! Is enough!<br>
A Sailor's business is the shore!<br>
A Soldier's — balls! Who asketh more,<br>
Must seek the neighboring life!</p>
