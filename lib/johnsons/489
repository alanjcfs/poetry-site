<p>We pray — to Heaven —<br>
We prate — of Heaven —<br>
Relate — when Neighbors die —<br>
At what o'clock to heaven — they fled —<br>
Who saw them — Wherefore fly?<br><br>
Is Heaven a Place — a Sky — a Tree?<br>
Location's narrow way is for Ourselves —<br>
Unto the Dead<br>
There's no Geography —<br><br>
But State — Endowal — Focus —<br>
Where — Omnipresence — fly?</p>
