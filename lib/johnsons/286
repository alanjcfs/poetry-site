<p>That after Horror — that 'twas us —<br>
That passed the mouldering Pier —<br>
Just as the Granite Crumb let go —<br>
Our Savior, by a Hair —<br><br>
A second more, had dropped too deep<br>
For Fisherman to plumb —<br>
The very profile of the Thought<br>
Puts Recollection numb —<br><br>
The possibility — to pass<br>
Without a Moment's Bell —<br>
Into Conjecture's presence —<br>
Is like a Face of Steel —<br>
That suddenly looks into ours<br>
With a metallic grin —<br>
The Cordiality of Death —<br>
Who drills his Welcome in —</p>
