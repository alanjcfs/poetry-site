<p>There is a word<br>
Which bears a sword<br>
Can pierce an armed man -<br>
It hurls it's barbed syllables<br>
And is mute again -<br>
But where it fell<br>
The Saved will tell<br>
On patriotic day,<br>
Some epauletted Brother<br>
Gave his breath away!<br><br>
Wherever runs the breathless sun -<br>
Wherever roams the day -<br>
There is it's noiseless onset -<br>
There is it's victory!<br>
Behold the keenest marksman-<br>
The most accomplished host!<br>
Time's sublimest target<br>
Is a soul "forgot"!</p>
