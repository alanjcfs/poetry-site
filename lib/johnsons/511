I'd brush the summer by<br>
With half a smile and half a spurn,<br>
As housewives do a fly.<br><br>
If I could see you in a year,<br>
I'd wind the months in balls,<br>
And put them each in separate drawers,<br>
Until their time befalls.<br><br>
If only centuries delayed,<br>
I'd count them on my hand,<br>
Subtracting till my fingers dropped<br>
Into Van Diemen's land.<br><br>
If certain, when this life was out<br>
That yours and mine should be,<br>
I'd toss it yonder like a rind,<br>
And taste eternity.</p>
