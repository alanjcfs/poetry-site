<p>'Twas Crisis — All the length had passed —<br>
That dull — benumbing time<br>
There is in Fever or Event —<br>
And now the Chance had come —<br><br>
The instant holding in its claw<br>
The privilege to live<br>
Or warrant to report the Soul<br>
The other side the Grave.<br><br>
The Muscles grappled as with leads<br>
That would not let the Will —<br>
The Spirit shook the Adamant —<br>
But could not make it feel.<br><br>
The Second poised — debated — shot —<br>
Another had begun —<br>
And simultaneously, a Soul<br>
Escaped the House unseen —</p>
