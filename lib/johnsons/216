<p>Safe in their Alabaster Chambers —<br>
Untouched by Morning<br>
And untouched by Noon —<br>
Sleep the meek members of the Resurrection —<br>
Rafter of satin,<br>
And Roof of stone.<br>
<br>
Light laughs the breeze<br>
In her Castle above them —<br>
Babbles the Bee in a stolid Ear,<br>
Pipe the Sweet Birds in ignorant cadence —<br>
Ah, what sagacity perished here!<br>
<br>
Grand go the years in the crescent above them;<br>
Worlds scoop their arcs, and firmaments row,<br>
Diadems drop and Doges surrender,<br>
Soundless as dots on a disk of snow.</p>
