<p>The Sunrise runs for Both —<br>
The East — Her Purple Troth<br>
Keeps with the Hill —<br>
The Noon unwinds Her Blue<br>
Till One Breadth cover Two —<br>
Remotest — still —<br><br>
Nor does the Night forget<br>
A Lamp for Each — to set —<br>
Wicks wide away —<br>
The North — Her blazing Sign<br>
Erects in Iodine —<br>
Till Both — can see —<br><br>
The Midnight's Dusky Arms<br>
Clasp Hemispheres, and Homes<br>
And so<br>
Upon Her Bosom — One —<br>
And One upon Her Hem —<br>
Both lie —</p>
