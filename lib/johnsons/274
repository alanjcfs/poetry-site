<p>The only Ghost I ever saw<br>
Was dressed in Mechlin — so —<br>
He wore no sandal on his foot —<br>
And stepped like flakes of snow —<br><br>
His Gait — was soundless, like the Bird —<br>
But rapid — like the Roe —<br>
His fashions, quaint, Mosaic —<br>
Or haply, Mistletoe —<br><br>
His conversation — seldom —<br>
His laughter, like the Breeze —<br>
That dies away in Dimples<br>
Among the pensive Trees —<br><br>
Our interview — was transient —<br>
Of me, himself was shy —<br>
And God forbid I look behind —<br>
Since that appalling Day!</p>
