<p>Some Rainbow — coming from the Fair!<br>
Some Vision of the World Cashmere —<br>
I confidently see!<br>
Or else a Peacock's purple Train<br>
Feather by feather — on the plain<br>
Fritters itself away!<br><br>
The dreamy Butterflies bestir!<br>
Lethargic pools resume the whir<br>
Of last year's sundered tune!<br>
From some old Fortress on the sun<br>
Baronial Bees — march — one by one —<br>
In murmuring platoon!<br><br>
The Robins stand as thick today<br>
As flakes of snow stood yesterday —<br>
On fence — and Roof — and Twig!<br>
The Orchis binds her feather on<br>
For her old lover - Don the Sun!<br>
Revisiting the Bog!<br><br>
Without Commander! Countless! Still!<br>
The Regiments of Wood and Hill<br>
In bright detachment stand!<br>
Behold! Whose Multitudes are these?<br>
The children of whose turbaned seas —<br>
Or what Circassian Land?</p>
