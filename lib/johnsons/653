<p>Of Being is a Bird<br>
The likest to the Down<br>
An Easy Breeze do put afloat<br>
The General Heavens — upon —<br><br>
It soars — and shifts — and whirls —<br>
And measures with the Clouds<br>
In easy — even — dazzling pace —<br>
No different the Birds —<br><br>
Except a Wake of Music<br>
Accompany their feet —<br>
As did the Down emit a Tune —<br>
For Ecstasy — of it</p>
