<p>Bereaved of all, I went abroad —<br>
No less bereaved was I<br>
Upon a New Peninsula —<br>
The Grave preceded me —<br>
<br>
Obtained my Lodgings, ere myself —<br>
And when I sought my Bed —<br>
The Grave it was reposed upon<br>
The Pillow for my Head —<br>
<br>
I waked to find it first awake —<br>
I rose — It followed me —<br>
I tried to drop it in the Crowd —<br>
To lose it in the Sea —<br>
<br>
In Cups of artificial Drowse<br>
To steep its shape away —<br>
The Grave — was finished — but the Spade<br>
Remained in Memory —</p>
