<p>A Night — there lay the Days between —<br>
The Day that was Before —<br>
And Day that was Behind — were one —<br>
And now — 'twas Night — was here —<br><br>
Slow — Night — that must be watched away —<br>
As Grains upon a shore —<br>
Too imperceptible to note —<br>
Till it be night — no more —</p>
