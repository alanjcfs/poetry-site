<p>The spry Arms of the Wind<br>
If I could crawl between<br>
I have an errand imminent<br>
To an adjoining Zone —<br><br>
I should not care to stop<br>
My Process is not long<br>
The Wind could wait without the Gate<br>
Or stroll the Town among.<br><br>
To ascertain the House<br>
And is the soul at Home<br>
And hold the Wick of mine to it<br>
To light, and then return —</p>
