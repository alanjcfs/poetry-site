<p>The Sun kept setting — setting — still<br>
No Hue of Afternoon —<br>
Upon the Village I perceived<br>
From House to House 'twas Noon —<br><br>
The Dusk kept dropping — dropping — still<br>
No Dew upon the Grass —<br>
But only on my Forehead stopped —<br>
And wandered in my Face —<br><br>
My Feet kept drowsing — drowsing — still<br>
My fingers were awake —<br>
Yet why so little sound — Myself<br>
Unto my Seeming — make?<br><br>
How well I knew the Light before —<br>
I could see it now —<br>
'Tis Dying — I am doing — but<br>
I'm not afraid to know —</p>
