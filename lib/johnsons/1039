<p>I heard, as if I had no Ear<br>
Until a Vital Word<br>
Came all the way from Life to me<br>
And then I knew I heard.<br><br>
I saw, as if my Eye were on<br>
Another, till a Thing<br>
And now I know 'twas Light, because<br>
It fitted them, came in.<br><br>
I dwelt, as if Myself, were out,<br>
My Body but within<br>
Until a Might detected me<br>
And set my kernel in.<br><br>
And Spirit turned unto the Dust<br>
"Old Friend, thou knowest me,"<br>
And Time went out to tell the News<br>
And met Eternity.</p>
