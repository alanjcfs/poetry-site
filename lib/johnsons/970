<p>Color — Caste — Denomination —<br>
These — are Time's Affair —<br>
Death's diviner Classifying<br>
Does not know they are —<br>
<br>
As in sleep — All Hue forgotten —<br>
Tenets — put behind —<br>
Death's large — Democratic fingers<br>
Rub away the Brand —<br>
<br>
If Circassian — He is careless —<br>
If He put away<br>
Chrysalis of Blonde — or Umber —<br>
Equal Butterfly —<br>
<br>
They emerge from His Obscuring —<br>
What Death — knows so well —<br>
Our minuter intuitions —<br>
Deem unplausible —</p>
