<p>In falling Timbers buried —<br>
There breathed a Man —<br>
Outside — the spades — were plying —<br>
The Lungs — within —<br><br>
Could He — know — they sought Him —<br>
Could They — know — He breathed —<br>
Horrid Sand Partition —<br>
Neither — could be heard —<br><br>
Never slacked the Diggers —<br>
But when Spades had done —<br>
Oh, Reward of Anguish,<br>
It was dying — Then —<br><br>
Many Things — are fruitless —<br>
'Tis a Baffling Earth —<br>
But there is no Gratitude<br>
Like the Grace — of Death —</p>
