<p>The Day came slow — till Five o'clock —<br>
Then sprang before the Hills<br>
Like Hindered Rubies — or the Light<br>
A Sudden Musket — spills —<br><br>
The Purple could not keep the East —<br>
The Sunrise shook abroad<br>
Like Breadths of Topaz — packed a Night —<br>
The Lady just unrolled —<br><br>
The Happy Winds — their Timbrels took —<br>
The Birds — in docile Rows<br>
Arranged themselves around their Prince<br>
The Wind — is Prince of Those —<br><br>
The Orchard sparkled like a Jew —<br>
How mighty 'twas — to be<br>
A Guest in this stupendous place —<br>
The Parlor — of the Day —</p>
