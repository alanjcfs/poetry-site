<p>The butterfly obtains<br>
But little sympathy<br>
Though favorably mentioned<br>
In Entomology —<br><br>
Because he travels freely<br>
And wears a proper coat<br>
The circumspect are certain<br>
That he is dissolute —<br><br>
Had he the homely scutcheon<br>
Of modest Industry<br>
'Twere fitter certifying<br>
For Immortality —</p>
