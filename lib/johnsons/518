<p>Her sweet Weight on my Heart a Night<br>
Had scarcely deigned to lie —<br>
When, stirring, for Belief's delight,<br>
My Bride had slipped away —<br><br>
If 'twas a Dream — made solid — just<br>
The Heaven to confirm —<br>
Or if Myself were dreamed of Her —<br>
The power to presume —<br><br>
With Him remain — who unto Me —<br>
Gave — even as to All —<br>
A Fiction superseding Faith —<br>
By so much — as 'twas real —</p>
