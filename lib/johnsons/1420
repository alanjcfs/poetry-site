<p>One Joy of so much anguish<br>
Sweet nature has for me<br>
I shun it as I do Despair<br>
Or dear iniquity —<br>
Why Birds, a Summer morning<br>
Before the Quick of Day<br>
Should stab my ravished spirit<br>
With Dirks of Melody<br>
Is part of an inquiry<br>
That will receive reply<br>
When Flesh and Spirit sunder<br>
In Death's Immediately —</p>
