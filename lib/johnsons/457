<p>Sweet — safe — Houses —<br>
Glad — gay — Houses —<br>
Sealed so stately tight —<br>
Lids of Steel — on Lids of Marble —<br>
Locking Bare feet out —<br><br>
Brooks of Plush — in Banks of Satin<br>
Not so softly fall<br>
As the laughter — and the whisper —<br>
From their People Pearl —<br><br>
No Bald Death — affront their Parlors —<br>
No Bold Sickness come<br>
To deface their Stately Treasures —<br>
Anguish — and the Tomb —<br><br>
Hum by — in Muffled Coaches —<br>
Lest they — wonder Why —<br>
Any — for the Press of Smiling —<br>
Interrupt — to die —</p>
