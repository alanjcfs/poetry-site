<p>The Child's faith is new —<br>
Whole — like His Principle —<br>
Wide — like the Sunrise<br>
On fresh Eyes —<br>
Never had a Doubt —<br>
Laughs — at a Scruple —<br>
Believes all sham<br>
But Paradise —<br><br>
Credits the World —<br>
Deems His Dominion<br>
Broadest of Sovereignties —<br>
And Caesar — mean —<br>
In the Comparison —<br>
Baseless Emperor —<br>
Ruler of Nought —<br>
Yet swaying all —<br><br>
Grown bye and bye<br>
To hold mistaken<br>
His pretty estimates<br>
Of Prickly Things<br>
He gains the skill<br>
Sorrowful — as certain —<br>
Men — to anticipate<br>
Instead of Kings —</p>
