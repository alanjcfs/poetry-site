<p>Wert Thou but ill — that I might show thee<br>
How long a Day I could endure<br>
Though thine attention stop not on me<br>
Nor the least signal, Me assure —<br><br>
Wert Thou but Stranger in ungracious country —<br>
And Mine — the Door<br>
Thou paused at, for a passing bounty —<br>
No More —<br><br>
Accused — wert Thou — and Myself — Tribunal —<br>
Convicted — Sentenced — Ermine — not to Me<br>
Half the Condition, thy Reverse — to follow —<br>
Just to partake — the infamy —<br><br>
The Tenant of the Narrow Cottage, wert Thou —<br>
Permit to be<br>
The Housewife in thy low attendance<br>
Contenteth Me —<br><br>
No Service hast Thou, I would not achieve it —<br>
To die — or live —<br>
The first — Sweet, proved I, ere I saw thee —<br>
For Life — be Love —</p>
