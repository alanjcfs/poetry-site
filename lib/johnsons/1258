<p>Who were "the Father and the Son"<br>
We pondered when a child,<br>
And what had they to do with us<br>
And when portentous told<br><br>
With inference appalling<br>
By Childhood fortified<br>
We thought, at least they are no worse<br>
Than they have been described.<br><br>
Who are "the Father and the Son"<br>
Did we demand Today<br>
"The Father and the Son" himself<br>
Would doubtless specify —<br><br>
But had they the felicity<br>
When we desired to know.<br>
We better Friends had been, perhaps,<br>
Than time ensue to be —<br><br>
We start — to learn that we believe<br>
But once — entirely —<br>
Belief, it does not fit so well<br>
When altered frequently —<br><br>
We blush, that Heaven if we achieve —<br>
Event ineffable —<br>
We shall have shunned until ashamed<br>
To own the Miracle —</p>
