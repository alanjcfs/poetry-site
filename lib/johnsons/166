<p>I met a King this afternoon!<br>
He had not on a Crown indeed,<br>
A little Palmleaf Hat was all,<br>
And he was barefoot, I'm afraid!<br><br>
But sure I am he Ermine wore<br>
Beneath his faded Jacket's blue —<br>
And sure I am, the crest he bore<br>
Within that Jacket's pocket too!<br><br>
For 'twas too stately for an Earl —<br>
A Marquis would not go so grand!<br>
'Twas possibly a Czar petite —<br>
A Pope, or something of that kind!<br><br>
If I must tell you, of a Horse<br>
My freckled Monarch held the rein —<br>
Doubtless an estimable Beast,<br>
But not at all disposed to run!<br><br>
And such a wagon! While I live<br>
Dare I presume to see<br>
Another such a vehicle<br>
As then transported me!<br><br>
Two other ragged Princes<br>
His royal state partook!<br>
Doubtless the first excursion<br>
These sovereigns ever took!<br><br>
I question if the Royal Coach<br>
Round which the Footmen wait<br>
Has the significance, on high,<br>
Of this Barefoot Estate!</p>
