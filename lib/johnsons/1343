<p>A single Clover Plank<br>
Was all that saved a Bee<br>
A Bee I personally knew<br>
From sinking in the sky —<br><br>
'Twixt Firmament above<br>
And Firmament below<br>
The Billows of Circumference<br>
Were sweeping him away —<br><br>
The idly swaying Plank<br>
Responsible to nought<br>
A sudden Freight of Wind assumed<br>
And Bumble Bee was not —<br><br>
This harrowing event<br>
Transpiring in the Grass<br>
Did not so much as wring from him<br>
A wandering "Alas" —</p>
