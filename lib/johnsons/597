<p>It always felt to me — a wrong<br>
To that Old Moses — done —<br>
To let him see — the Canaan —<br>
Without the entering —<br><br>
And tho' in soberer moments —<br>
No Moses there can be<br>
I'm satisfied — the Romance<br>
In point of injury —<br><br>
Surpasses sharper stated —<br>
Of Stephen — or of Paul —<br>
For these — were only put to death —<br>
While God's adroiter will<br><br>
On Moses — seemed to fasten<br>
With tantalizing Play<br>
As Boy — should deal with lesser Boy —<br>
To prove ability.<br><br>
The fault — was doubtless Israel's —<br>
Myself — had banned the Tribes —<br>
And ushered Grand Old Moses<br>
In Pentateuchal Robes<br><br>
Upon the Broad Possession<br>
'Twas little — But titled Him — to see —<br>
Old Man on Nebo! Late as this —<br>
My justice bleeds — for Thee!</p>
