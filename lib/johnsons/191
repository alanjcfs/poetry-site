<p>The Skies can't keep their secret!<br>
They tell it to the Hills —<br>
The Hills just tell the Orchards —<br>
And they — the Daffodils!<br><br>
A Bird — by chance — that goes that way —<br>
Soft overhears the whole —<br>
If I should bribe the little Bird —<br>
Who knows but she would tell?<br><br>
I think I won't — however —<br>
It's finer — not to know —<br>
If Summer were an Axiom —<br>
What sorcery had Snow?<br><br>
So keep your secret — Father!<br>
I would not — if I could,<br>
Know what the Sapphire Fellows, do,<br>
In your new-fashioned world!</p>
