<p>Expanse cannot be lost —<br>
Not Joy, but a Decree<br>
Is Deity —<br>
His Scene, Infinity —<br>
Whose rumor's Gate was shut so tight<br>
Before my Beam was sown,<br>
Not even a Prognostic's push<br>
Could make a Dent thereon —<br><br>
The World that thou hast opened<br>
Shuts for thee,<br>
But not alone,<br>
We all have followed thee —<br>
Escape more slowly<br>
To thy Tracts of Sheen —<br>
The Tent is listening,<br>
But the Troops are gone!</p>
