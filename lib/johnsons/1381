<p>I suppose the time will come<br>
Aid it in the coming<br>
When the Bird will crowd the Tree<br>
And the Bee be booming.<br><br>
I suppose the time will come<br>
Hinder it a little<br>
When the Corn in Silk will dress<br>
And in Chintz the Apple<br><br>
I believe the Day will be<br>
When the Jay will giggle<br>
At his new white House the Earth<br>
That, too, halt a little â€”</p>
