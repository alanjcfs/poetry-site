<p>Here, where the Daisies fit my Head<br>
'Tis easiest to lie<br>
And every Grass that plays outside<br>
Is sorry, some, for me.<br><br>
Where I am not afraid to go<br>
I may confide my Flower —<br>
Who was not Enemy of Me<br>
Will gentle be, to Her.<br><br>
Nor separate, Herself and Me<br>
By Distances become —<br>
A single Bloom we constitute<br>
Departed, or at Home —</p>
