<p>The Outer — from the Inner<br>
Derives its Magnitude —<br>
'Tis Duke, or Dwarf, according<br>
As is the Central Mood —<br><br>
The fine — unvarying Axis<br>
That regulates the Wheel —<br>
Though Spokes — spin — more conspicuous<br>
And fling a dust — the while.<br><br>
The Inner — paints the Outer —<br>
The Brush without the Hand —<br>
Its Picture publishes — precise —<br>
As is the inner Brand —<br><br>
On fine — Arterial Canvas —<br>
A Cheek — perchance a Brow —<br>
The Star's whole Secret — in the Lake —<br>
Eyes were not meant to know.</p>
