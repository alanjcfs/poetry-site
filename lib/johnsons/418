<p>Not in this World to see his face —<br>
Sounds long — until I read the place<br>
Where this — is said to be<br>
But just the Primer — to a life —<br>
Unopened — rare — Upon the Shelf —<br>
Clasped yet — to Him — and Me —<br>
<br>
And yet — My Primer suits me so<br>
I would not choose — a Book to know<br>
Than that — be sweeter wise —<br>
Might some one else — so learned — be —<br>
And leave me — just my A — B — C —<br>
Himself — could have the Skies —</p>
