<p>No matter — now — Sweet —<br>
But when I'm Earl —<br>
Won't you wish you'd spoken<br>
To that dull Girl?<br><br>
Trivial a Word — just —<br>
Trivial — a Smile —<br>
But won't you wish you'd spared one<br>
When I'm Earl?<br><br>
I shan't need it — then —<br>
Crests — will do —<br>
Eagles on my Buckles —<br>
On my Belt — too —<br><br>
Ermine — my familiar Gown —<br>
Say — Sweet — then<br>
Won't you wish you'd smiled — just —<br>
Me upon?</p>
