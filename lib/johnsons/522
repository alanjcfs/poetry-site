<p>Had I presumed to hope —<br>
The loss had been to Me<br>
A Value — for the Greatness' Sake —<br>
As Giants — gone away —<br><br>
Had I presumed to gain<br>
A Favor so remote —<br>
The failure but confirm the Grace<br>
In further Infinite —<br><br>
'Tis failure — not of Hope —<br>
But Confident Despair —<br>
Advancing on Celestial Lists —<br>
With faint — Terrestial power —<br><br>
'Tis Honor — though I die —<br>
For That no Man obtain<br>
Till He be justified by Death —<br>
This — is the Second Gain —</p>
