<p>Out of sight? What of that?<br>
See the Bird — reach it!<br>
Curve by Curve — Sweep by Sweep —<br>
Round the Steep Air —<br>
Danger! What is that to Her?<br>
Better 'tis to fail — there —<br>
Than debate — here —<br><br>
Blue is Blue — the World through —<br>
Amber — Amber — Dew — Dew —<br>
Seek — Friend — and see —<br>
Heaven is shy of Earth — that's all —<br>
Bashful Heaven — thy Lovers small —<br>
Hide — too — from thee —</p>
