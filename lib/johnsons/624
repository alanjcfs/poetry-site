<p>Forever — is composed of Nows —<br>
'Tis not a different time —<br>
Except for Infiniteness —<br>
And Latitude of Home —<br><br>
From this — experienced Here —<br>
Remove the Dates — to These —<br>
Let Months dissolve in further Months —<br>
And Years — exhale in Years —<br><br>
Without Debate — or Pause —<br>
Or Celebrated Days —<br>
No different Our Years would be<br>
From Anno Domini's —</p>
