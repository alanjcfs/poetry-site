<p>We should not mind so small a flower —<br>
Except it quiet bring<br>
Our little garden that we lost<br>
Back to the Lawn again.<br><br>
So spicy her Carnations nod —<br>
So drunken, reel her Bees —<br>
So silver steal a hundred flutes<br>
From out a hundred trees —<br><br>
That whoso sees this little flower<br>
By faith may clear behold<br>
The Bobolinks around the throne<br>
And Dandelions gold.</p>
