<p>Inconceivably solemn!<br>
Things go gay<br>
Pierce — by the very Press<br>
Of Imagery —<br><br>
Their far Parades — order on the eye<br>
With a mute Pomp —<br>
A pleading Pageantry —<br><br>
Flags, are a brave sight —<br>
But no true Eye<br>
Ever went by One —<br>
Steadily —<br><br>
Music's triumphant —<br>
But the fine Ear<br>
Winces with delight<br>
Are Drums too near —</p>
