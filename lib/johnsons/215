<p>What is — "Paradise" —<br>
Who live there —<br>
Are they "Farmers" —<br>
Do they "hoe" —<br>
Do they know that this is "Amherst" —<br>
And that I — am coming — too —<br><br>
Do they wear "new shoes" — in "Eden" —<br>
Is it always pleasant — there —<br>
Won't they scold us — when we're homesick —<br>
Or tell God — how cross we are —<br><br>
You are sure there's such a person<br>
As "a Father" — in the sky —<br>
So if I get lost — there — ever —<br>
Or do what the Nurse calls "die" —<br>
I shan't walk the "Jasper" — barefoot —<br>
Ransomed folks — won't laugh at me —<br>
Maybe — "Eden" a'n't so lonesome<br>
As New England used to be!</p>
