<p>There's something quieter than sleep<br>
Within this inner room!<br>
It wears a sprig upon its breast —<br>
And will not tell its name.<br><br>
Some touch it, and some kiss it —<br>
Some chafe its idle hand —<br>
It has a simple gravity<br>
I do not understand!<br><br>
I would not weep if I were they —<br>
How rude in one to sob!<br>
Might scare the quiet fairy<br>
Back to her native wood!<br><br>
While simple-hearted neighbors<br>
Chat of the "Early dead" —<br>
We — prone to periphrasis<br>
Remark that Birds have fled!</p>
