<p>They called me to the Window, for<br>
" 'Twas Sunset" — Some one said —<br>
I only saw a Sapphire Farm —<br>
And just a Single Herd —<br><br>
Of Opal Cattle — feeding far<br>
Upon so vain a Hill —<br>
As even while I looked — dissolved —<br>
Nor Cattle were — nor Soil —<br><br>
But in their stead — a Sea — displayed —<br>
And Ships — of such a size<br>
As Crew of Mountains — could afford —<br>
And Decks — to seat the skies —<br><br>
This — too — the Showman rubbed away —<br>
And when I looked again —<br>
Nor Farm — nor Opal Herd — was there —<br>
Nor Mediterranean —</p>
