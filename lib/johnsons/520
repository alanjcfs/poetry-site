<p>I started Early — Took my Dog —<br>
And visited the Sea —<br>
The Mermaids in the Basement<br>
Came out to look at me —<br><br>
And Frigates — in the Upper Floor<br>
Extended Hempen Hands —<br>
Presuming Me to be a Mouse —<br>
Aground — upon the Sands —<br><br>
But no Man moved Me — till the Tide<br>
Went past my simple Shoe —<br>
And past my Apron — and my Belt —<br>
And past my Bodice — too —<br><br>
And made as He would eat me up —<br>
As wholly as a Dew<br>
Upon a Dandelion's Sleeve —<br>
And then — I started — too —<br><br>
And He — He followed — close behind —<br>
I felt his Silver Heel<br>
Upon my Ankle — Then my Shoes<br>
Would overflow with Pearl —<br><br>
Until We met the Solid Town —<br>
No One He seemed to know —<br>
And bowing — with a Mighty look —<br>
At me — The Sea withdrew —</p>
