<p>Make me a picture of the sun —<br>
So I can hang it in my room —<br>
And make believe I'm getting warm<br>
When others call it "Day"!<br>
<br>
Draw me a Robin — on a stem —<br>
So I am hearing him, I'll dream,<br>
And when the Orchards stop their tune —<br>
Put my pretense — away —<br>
<br>
Say if it's really — warm at noon —<br>
Whether it's Buttercups — that "skim" —<br>
Or Butterflies — that "bloom"?<br>
Then — skip — the frost — upon the lea —<br>
And skip the Russet — on the tree —<br>
Let's play those — never come!</p>
