<p>I tried to think a lonelier Thing<br>
Than any I had seen —<br>
Some Polar Expiation — An Omen in the Bone<br>
Of Death's tremendous nearness —<br><br>
I probed Retrieveless things<br>
My Duplicate — to borrow —<br>
A Haggard Comfort springs<br><br>
From the belief that Somewhere —<br>
Within the Clutch of Thought —<br>
There dwells one other Creature<br>
Of Heavenly Love — forgot —<br><br>
I plucked at our Partition<br>
As One should pry the Walls —<br>
Between Himself — and Horror's Twin —<br>
Within Opposing Cells —<br><br>
I almost strove to clasp his Hand,<br>
Such Luxury — it grew —<br>
That as Myself — could pity Him —<br>
Perhaps he — pitied me —</p>
