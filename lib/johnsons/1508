<p>You cannot make Remembrance grow<br>
When it has lost its Root —<br>
The tightening the Soil around<br>
And setting it upright<br>
Deceives perhaps the Universe<br>
But not retrieves the Plant —<br>
Real Memory, like Cedar Feet<br>
Is shod with Adamant —<br>
Nor can you cut Remembrance down<br>
When it shall once have grown —<br>
Its Iron Buds will sprout anew<br>
However overthrown —</p>
