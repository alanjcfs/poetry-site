<p>'Tis One by One — the Father counts —<br>
And then a Tract between<br>
Set Cypherless — to teach the Eye<br>
The Value of its Ten —<br><br>
Until the peevish Student<br>
Acquire the Quick of Skill —<br>
Then Numerals are dowered back —<br>
Adorning all the Rule —<br><br>
'Tis mostly Slate and Pencil —<br>
And Darkness on the School<br>
Distracts the Children's fingers —<br>
Still the Eternal Rule<br><br>
Regards least Cypherer alike<br>
With Leader of the Band —<br>
And every separate Urchin's Sum —<br>
Is fashioned for his hand —</p>
