<p>A Pit — but Heaven over it —<br>
And Heaven beside, and Heaven abroad,<br>
And yet a Pit —<br>
With Heaven over it.<br><br>
To stir would be to slip —<br>
To look would be to drop —<br>
To dream — to sap the Prop<br>
That holds my chances up.<br>
Ah! Pit! With Heaven over it!<br><br>
The depth is all my thought —<br>
I dare not ask my feet —<br>
'Twould start us where we sit<br>
So straight you'd scarce suspect<br>
It was a Pit — with fathoms under it —<br>
Its Circuit just the same.<br>
Seed — summer — tomb —<br>
Whose Doom to whom?</p>
