<p>One of the ones that Midas touched<br>
Who failed to touch us all<br>
Was that confiding Prodigal<br>
The reeling Oriole —<br><br>
So drunk he disavows it<br>
With badinage divine —<br>
So dazzling we mistake him<br>
For an alighting Mine —<br><br>
A Pleader — a Dissembler —<br>
An Epicure — a Thief —<br>
Betimes an Oratorio —<br>
An Ecstasy in chief —<br><br>
The Jesuit of Orchards<br>
He cheats as he enchants<br>
Of an entire Attar<br>
For his decamping wants —<br><br>
The splendor of a Burmah<br>
The Meteor of Birds,<br>
Departing like a Pageant<br>
Of Ballads and of Bards —<br><br>
I never thought that Jason sought<br>
For any Golden Fleece<br>
But then I am a rural man<br>
With thoughts that make for Peace —<br><br>
But if there were a Jason,<br>
Tradition bear with me<br>
Behold his lost Aggrandizement<br>
Upon the Apple Tree —</p>
