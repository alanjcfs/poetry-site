<p>These are the Nights that Beetles love —<br>
From Eminence remote<br>
Drives ponderous perpendicular<br>
His figure intimate<br>
The terror of the Children<br>
The merriment of men<br>
Depositing his Thunder<br>
He hoists abroad again —<br>
A Bomb upon the Ceiling<br>
Is an improving thing —<br>
It keeps the nerves progressive<br>
Conjecture flourishing —<br>
Too dear the Summer evening<br>
Without discreet alarm —<br>
Supplied by Entomology<br>
With its remaining charm —</p>
