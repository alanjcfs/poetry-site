<p>A little East of Jordan,<br>
Evangelists record,<br>
A Gymnast and an Angel<br>
Did wrestle long and hard —<br><br>
Till morning touching mountain —<br>
And Jacob, waxing strong,<br>
The Angel begged permission<br>
To Breakfast — to return —<br><br>
Not so, said cunning Jacob!<br>
"I will not let thee go<br>
Except thou bless me" — Stranger!<br>
The which acceded to —<br><br>
Light swung the silver fleeces<br>
"Peniel" Hills beyond,<br>
And the bewildered Gymnast<br>
Found he had worsted God!</p>
