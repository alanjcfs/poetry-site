<p>Publication — is the Auction<br>
Of the Mind of Man —<br>
Poverty — be justifying<br>
For so foul a thing<br><br>
Possibly — but We — would rather<br>
From Our Garret go<br>
White — Unto the White Creator —<br>
Than invest — Our Snow —<br><br>
Thought belong to Him who gave it —<br>
Then — to Him Who bear<br>
Its Corporeal illustration — Sell<br>
The Royal Air —<br><br>
In the Parcel — Be the Merchant<br>
Of the Heavenly Grace —<br>
But reduce no Human Spirit<br>
To Disgrace of Price —</p>
