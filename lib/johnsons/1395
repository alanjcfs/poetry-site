<p>After all Birds have been investigated and laid aside —<br>
Nature imparts the little Blue-Bird — assured<br>
Her conscientious Voice will soar unmoved<br>
Above ostensible Vicissitude.<br><br>
First at the March — competing with the Wind —<br>
Her panting note exalts us — like a friend —<br>
Last to adhere when Summer cleaves away —<br>
Elegy of Integrity.</p>
