<p>The face I carry with me — last —<br>
When I go out of Time —<br>
To take my Rank — by — in the West —<br>
That face — will just be thine —<br><br>
I'll hand it to the Angel —<br>
That — Sir — was my Degree —<br>
In Kingdoms — you have heard the Raised —<br>
Refer to — possibly.<br><br>
He'll take it — scan it — step aside —<br>
Return — with such a crown<br>
As Gabriel — never capered at —<br>
And beg me put it on —<br><br>
And then — he'll turn me round and round —<br>
To an admiring sky —<br>
As one that bore her Master's name —<br>
Sufficient Royalty!</p>
