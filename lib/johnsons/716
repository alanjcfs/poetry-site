<p>The Day undressed — Herself —<br>
Her Garter — was of Gold —<br>
Her Petticoat — of Purple plain —<br>
Her Dimities — as old<br><br>
Exactly — as the World —<br>
And yet the newest Star —<br>
Enrolled upon the Hemisphere<br>
Be wrinkled — much as Her —<br><br>
Too near to God — to pray —<br>
Too near to Heaven — to fear —<br>
The Lady of the Occident<br>
Retired without a care —<br><br>
Her Candle so expire<br>
The flickering be seen<br>
On Ball of Mast in Bosporus —<br>
And Dome — and Window Pane —</p>
