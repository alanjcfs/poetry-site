<p>What did They do since I saw Them?<br>
Were They industrious?<br>
So many questions to put Them<br>
Have I the eagerness<br><br>
That could I snatch Their Faces<br>
That could Their lips reply<br>
Not till the last was answered<br>
Should They start for the Sky.<br><br>
Not if Their Party were waiting,<br>
Not if to talk with Me<br>
Were to Them now, Homesickness<br>
After Eternity.<br><br>
Not if the Just suspect me<br>
And offer a Reward<br>
Would I restore my Booty<br>
To that Bold Person, God â€”</p>
