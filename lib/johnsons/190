<p>He was weak, and I was strong — then —<br>
So He let me lead him in —<br>
I was weak, and He was strong then —<br>
So I let him lead me — Home.<br>
<br>
'Twasn't far — the door was near —<br>
'Twasn't dark — for He went — too —<br>
'Twasn't loud, for He said nought —<br>
That was all I cared to know.<br>
<br>
Day knocked — and we must part —<br>
Neither — was strongest — now —<br>
He strove — and I strove — too —<br>
We didn't do it — tho'!</p>
