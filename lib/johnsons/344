<p>'Twas the old — road — through pain —<br>
That unfrequented — one —<br>
With many a turn — and thorn —<br>
That stops — at Heaven —<br><br>
This — was the Town — she passed —<br>
There — where she — rested — last —<br>
Then — stepped more fast —<br>
The little tracks — close prest —<br>
Then — not so swift —<br>
Slow — slow — as feet did weary — grow —<br>
Then — stopped — no other track!<br><br>
Wait! Look! Her little Book —<br>
The leaf — at love — turned back —<br>
Her very Hat —<br>
And this worn shoe just fits the track —<br>
Herself — though — fled!<br><br>
Another bed — a short one —<br>
Women make — tonight —<br>
In Chambers bright —<br>
Too out of sight — though —<br>
For our hoarse Good Night —<br>
To touch her Head!</p>
