<p>Myself was formed — a Carpenter —<br>
An unpretending time<br>
My Plane — and I, together wrought<br>
Before a Builder came —<br>
<br>
To measure our attainments —<br>
Had we the Art of Boards<br>
Sufficiently developed — He'd hire us<br>
At Halves —<br>
<br>
My Tools took Human — Faces —<br>
The Bench, where we had toiled —<br>
Against the Man — persuaded —<br>
We — Temples build — I said —</p>
