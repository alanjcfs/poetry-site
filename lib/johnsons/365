<p>Dare you see a Soul at the White Heat? —<br>
Then crouch within the door —<br>
Red — is the Fire's common tint —<br>
But when the vivid Ore<br>
Has vanquished Flame's conditions,<br>
It quivers from the Forge<br>
Without a color, but the light<br>
Of unanointed Blaze.<br>
Least Village has its Blacksmith<br>
Whose Anvil's even ring<br>
Stands symbol for the finer Forge<br>
That soundless tugs — within —<br>
Refining these impatient Ores<br>
With Hammer, and with Blaze<br>
Until the Designated Light<br>
Repudiate the Forge —</p>
