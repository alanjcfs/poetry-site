<p>I know where Wells grow — Droughtless Wells —<br>
Deep dug — for Summer days —<br>
Where Mosses go no more away —<br>
And Pebble — safely plays —<br>
<br>
It's made of Fathoms — and a Belt —<br>
A Belt of jagged Stone —<br>
Inlaid with Emerald — half way down —<br>
And Diamonds — jumbled on —<br>
<br>
It has no Bucket — Were I rich<br>
A Bucket I would buy —<br>
I'm often thirsty — but my lips<br>
Are so high up — You see —<br>
<br>
I read in an Old fashioned Book<br>
That People "thirst no more" —<br>
The Wells have Buckets to them there —<br>
It must mean that — I'm sure —<br>
<br>
Shall We remember Parching — then?<br>
Those Waters sound so grand —<br>
I think a little Well — like Mine —<br>
Dearer to understand —</p>
