It was a common night,<br>
Except the dying; this to us<br>
Made nature different.<br><br>
We noticed smallest things, â€”<br>
Things overlooked before,<br>
By this great light upon our minds<br>
Italicized, as 't were.<br><br>
That others could exist<br>
While she must finish quite,<br>
A jealousy for her arose<br>
So nearly infinite.<br><br>
We waited while she passed;<br>
It was a narrow time,<br>
Too jostled were our souls to speak,<br>
At length the notice came.</p>

<p>She mentioned, and forgot;<br>
Then lightly as a reed<br>
Bent to the water, shivered scarce,<br>
Consented, and was dead.<br><br>
And we, we placed the hair,<br>
And drew the head erect;<br>
And then an awful leisure was,<br>
Our faith to regulate.</p>
