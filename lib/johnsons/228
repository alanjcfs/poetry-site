<p>Blazing in Gold and quenching in Purple<br>
Leaping like Leopards to the Sky<br>
Then at the feet of the old Horizon<br>
Laying her spotted Face to die<br>
Stooping as low as the Otter's Window<br>
Touching the Roof and tinting the Barn<br>
Kissing her Bonnet to the Meadow<br>
And the Juggler of Day is gone</p>
