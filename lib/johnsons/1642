<p>"Red Sea," indeed! Talk not to me<br>
Of purple Pharaoh —<br>
I have a Navy in the West<br>
Would pierce his Columns thro' —<br>
Guileless, yet of such Glory fine<br>
That all along the Line<br>
Is it, or is it not, divine —<br>
The Eye inquires with a sigh<br>
That Earth sh'd be so big —<br>
What Exultation in the Woe —<br>
What Wine in the fatigue!</p>
