<p>In many and reportless places<br>
We feel a Joy —<br>
Reportless, also, but sincere as Nature<br>
Or Deity —<br><br>
It comes, without a consternation —<br>
Dissolves — the same —<br>
But leaves a sumptuous Destitution —<br>
Without a Name —<br><br>
Profane it by a search — we cannot<br>
It has no home —<br>
Nor we who having once inhaled it —<br>
Thereafter roam.</p>
