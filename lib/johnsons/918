<p>Only a Shrine, but Mine —<br>
I made the Taper shine —<br>
Madonna dim, to whom all Feet may come,<br>
Regard a Nun —<br><br>
Thou knowest every Woe —<br>
Needless to tell thee — so —<br>
But can'st thou do<br>
The Grace next to it — heal?<br>
That looks a harder skill to us —<br>
Still — just as easy, if it be thy Will<br>
To thee — Grant me —<br>
Thou knowest, though, so Why tell thee?</p>
