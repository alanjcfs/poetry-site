<p>I'm "wife" — I've finished that —<br>
That other state —<br>
I'm Czar — I'm "Woman" now —<br>
It's safer so —<br>
<br>
How odd the Girl's life looks<br>
Behind this soft Eclipse —<br>
I think that Earth feels so<br>
To folks in Heaven — now —<br>
<br>
This being comfort — then<br>
That other kind — was pain —<br>
But why compare?<br>
I'm "Wife"! Stop there!</p>
