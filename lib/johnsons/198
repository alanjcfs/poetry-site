<p>An awful Tempest mashed the air —<br>
The clouds were gaunt, and few —<br>
A Black — as of a Spectre's Cloak<br>
Hid Heaven and Earth from view.<br>
<br>
The creatures chuckled on the Roofs —<br>
And whistled in the air —<br>
And shook their fists —<br>
And gnashed their teeth —<br>
And swung their frenzied hair.<br>
<br>
The morning lit — the Birds arose —<br>
The Monster's faded eyes<br>
Turned slowly to his native coast —<br>
And peace — was Paradise!</p>
