<p>Alone, I cannot be —<br>
For Hosts — do visit me —<br>
Recordless Company —<br>
Who baffle Key —<br><br>
They have no Robes, nor Names —<br>
No Almanacs — nor Climes —<br>
But general Homes<br>
Like Gnomes —<br><br>
Their Coming, may be known<br>
By Couriers within —<br>
Their going — is not —<br>
For they've never gone —</p>
