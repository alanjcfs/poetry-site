<p>Never for Society<br>
He shall seek in vain —<br>
Who His own acquaintance<br>
Cultivate — Of Men<br>
Wiser Men may weary —<br>
But the Man within<br><br>
Never knew Satiety —<br>
Better entertain<br>
Than could Border Ballad —<br>
Or Biscayan Hymn —<br>
Neither introduction<br>
Need You — unto Him —</p>
