<p>To interrupt His Yellow Plan<br>
The Sun does not allow<br>
Caprices of the Atmosphere —<br>
And even when the Snow<br><br>
Heaves Balls of Specks, like Vicious Boy<br>
Directly in His Eye —<br>
Does not so much as turn His Head<br>
Busy with Majesty —<br><br>
'Tis His to stimulate the Earth —<br>
And magnetize the Sea —<br>
And bind Astronomy, in place,<br>
Yet Any passing by<br><br>
Would deem Ourselves — the busier<br>
As the Minutest Bee<br>
That rides — emits a Thunder —<br>
A Bomb — to justify —</p>
