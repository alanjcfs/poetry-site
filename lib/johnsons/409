<p>They dropped like Flakes —<br>
They dropped like Stars —<br>
Like Petals from a Rose —<br>
When suddenly across the June<br>
A wind with fingers — goes —<br><br>
They perished in the Seamless Grass —<br>
No eye could find the place —<br>
But God can summon every face<br>
Of his Repealless — List.</p>
