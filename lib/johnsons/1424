<p>The Gentian has a parched Corolla —<br>
Like azure dried<br>
'Tis Nature's buoyant juices<br>
Beatified —<br>
Without a vaunt or sheen<br>
As casual as Rain<br>
And as benign —<br><br>
When most is part — it comes —<br>
Nor isolate it seems<br>
Its Bond its Friend —<br>
To fill its Fringed career<br>
And aid an aged Year<br>
Abundant end —<br><br>
Its lot — were it forgot —<br>
This Truth endear —<br>
Fidelity is gain<br>
Creation is o'er —</p>
