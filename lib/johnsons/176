<p>I'm the little "Heart's Ease"!<br>
I don't care for pouting skies!<br>
If the Butterfly delay<br>
Can I, therefore, stay away?<br><br>
If the Coward Bumble Bee<br>
In his chimney corner stay,<br>
I, must resoluter be!<br>
Who'll apologize for me?<br><br>
Dear, Old fashioned, little flower!<br>
Eden is old fashioned, too!<br>
Birds are antiquated fellows!<br>
Heaven does not change her blue.<br>
Nor will I, the little Heart's Ease â€”<br>
Ever be induced to do!</p>
