<p>If I should die,<br>
And you should live —<br>
And time should gurgle on —<br>
And morn should beam —<br>
And noon should burn —<br>
As it has usual done —<br>
If Birds should build as early<br>
And Bees as bustling go —<br>
One might depart at option<br>
From enterprise below!<br>
'Tis sweet to know that stocks will stand<br>
When we with Daisies lie —<br>
That Commerce will continue —<br>
And Trades as briskly fly —<br>
It makes the parting tranquil<br>
And keeps the soul serene —<br>
That gentlemen so sprightly<br>
Conduct the pleasing scene!</p>
