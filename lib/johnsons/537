<p>Me prove it now — Whoever doubt<br>
Me stop to prove it — now —<br>
Make haste — the Scruple! Death be scant<br>
For Opportunity —<br><br>
The River reaches to my feet —<br>
As yet — My Heart be dry —<br>
Oh Lover — Life could not convince —<br>
Might Death — enable Thee —<br><br>
The River reaches to My Breast —<br>
Still — still — My Hands above<br>
Proclaim with their remaining Might —<br>
Dost recognize the Love?<br><br>
The River reaches to my Mouth —<br>
Remember — when the Sea<br>
Swept by my searching eyes — the last —<br>
Themselves were quick — with Thee!</p>
