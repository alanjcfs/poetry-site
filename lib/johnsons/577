<p>If I may have it, when it's dead,<br>
I'll be contented — so —<br>
If just as soon as Breath is out<br>
It shall belong to me —<br><br>
Until they lock it in the Grave,<br>
'Tis Bliss I cannot weigh —<br>
For tho' they lock Thee in the Grave,<br>
Myself — can own the key —<br><br>
Think of it Lover! I and Thee<br>
Permitted — face to face to be —<br>
After a Life — a Death — We'll say —<br>
For Death was That —<br>
And this — is Thee —<br><br>
I'll tell Thee All — how Bald it grew —<br>
How Midnight felt, at first — to me —<br>
How all the Clocks stopped in the World —<br>
And Sunshine pinched me — 'Twas so cold —<br><br>
Then how the Grief got sleepy — some —<br>
As if my Soul were deaf and dumb —<br>
Just making signs — across — to Thee —<br>
That this way — thou could'st notice me —<br><br>
I'll tell you how I tried to keep<br>
A smile, to show you, when this Deep<br>
All Waded — We look back for Play,<br>
At those Old Times — in Calvary,<br><br>
Forgive me, if the Grave come slow —<br>
For Coveting to look at Thee —<br>
Forgive me, if to stroke thy frost<br>
Outvisions Paradise!</p>
