<p>No Notice gave She, but a Change —<br>
No Message, but a Sigh —<br>
For Whom, the Time did not suffice<br>
That She should specify.<br><br>
She was not warm, though Summer shone<br>
Nor scrupulous of cold<br>
Though Rime by Rime, the steady Frost<br>
Upon Her Bosom piled —<br><br>
Of shrinking ways — she did not fright<br>
Though all the Village looked —<br>
But held Her gravity aloft —<br>
And met the gaze — direct —<br><br>
And when adjusted like a Seed<br>
In careful fitted Ground<br>
Unto the Everlasting Spring<br>
And hindered but a Mound<br><br>
Her Warm return, if so she chose —<br>
And We — imploring drew —<br>
Removed our invitation by<br>
As Some She never knew —</p>
