<p>The Heaven vests for Each<br>
In that small Deity<br>
It craved the grace to worship<br>
Some bashful Summer's Day —<br><br>
Half shrinking from the Glory<br>
It importuned to see<br>
Till these faint Tabernacles drop<br>
In full Eternity —<br><br>
How imminent the Venture —<br>
As one should sue a Star —<br>
For His mean sake to leave the Row<br>
And entertain Despair —<br><br>
A Clemency so common —<br>
We almost cease to fear —<br>
Enabling the minutest —<br>
And furthest — to adore —</p>
