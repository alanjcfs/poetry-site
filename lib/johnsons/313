<p>I should have been too glad, I see —<br>
Too lifted — for the scant degree<br>
Of Life's penurious Round —<br>
My little Circuit would have shamed<br>
This new Circumference — have blamed —<br>
The homelier time behind.<br>
<br>
I should have been too saved — I see —<br>
Too rescued — Fear too dim to me<br>
That I could spell the Prayer<br>
I knew so perfect — yesterday —<br>
That Scalding One — Sabachthani —<br>
Recited fluent — here —<br>
<br>
Earth would have been too much — I see —<br>
And Heaven — not enough for me —<br>
I should have had the Joy<br>
Without the Fear — to justify —<br>
The Palm — without the Calvary —<br>
So Savior — Crucify —<br>
Defeat — whets Victory — they say —<br>
The Reefs — in old Gethsemane —<br>
Endear the Coast — beyond!<br>
'Tis Beggars — Banquets — can define —<br>
'Tis Parching — vitalizes Wine —<br>
"Faith" bleats — to understand!</p>
