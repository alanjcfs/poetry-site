<p>I can't tell you — but you feel it —<br>
Nor can you tell me —<br>
Saints, with ravished slate and pencil<br>
Solve our April Day!<br>
<br>
Sweeter than a vanished frolic<br>
From a vanished green!<br>
Swifter than the hoofs of Horsemen<br>
Round a Ledge of dream!<br>
<br>
Modest, let us walk among it<br>
With our faces veiled —<br>
As they say polite Archangels<br>
Do in meeting God!<br>
<br>
Not for me — to prate about it!<br>
Not for you — to say<br>
To some fashionable Lady<br>
"Charming April Day"!<br>
<br>
Rather — Heaven's "Peter Parley"!<br>
By which Children slow<br>
To sublimer Recitation<br>
Are prepared to go!</p>
