<p>A Prison gets to be a friend —<br>
Between its Ponderous face<br>
And Ours — a Kinsmanship express —<br>
And in its narrow Eyes —<br><br>
We come to look with gratitude<br>
For the appointed Beam<br>
It deal us — stated as our food —<br>
And hungered for — the same —<br><br>
We learn to know the Planks —<br>
That answer to Our feet —<br>
So miserable a sound — at first —<br>
Nor ever now — so sweet —<br><br>
As plashing in the Pools —<br>
When Memory was a Boy —<br>
But a Demurer Circuit —<br>
A Geometric Joy —<br><br>
The Posture of the Key<br>
That interrupt the Day<br>
To Our Endeavor — Not so real<br>
The Check of Liberty —<br><br>
As this Phantasm Steel —<br>
Whose features — Day and Night —<br>
Are present to us — as Our Own —<br>
And as escapeless — quite —<br><br>
The narrow Round — the Stint —<br>
The slow exchange of Hope —<br>
For something passiver — Content<br>
Too steep for looking up —<br><br>
The Liberty we knew<br>
Avoided — like a Dream —<br>
Too wide for any Night but Heaven —<br>
If That — indeed — redeem —</p>
