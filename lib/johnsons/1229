<p>Because He loves Her<br>
We will pry and see if she is fair<br>
What difference is on her Face<br>
From Features others wear.<br><br>
It will not harm her magic pace<br>
That we so far behind â€”<br>
Her Distances propitiate<br>
As Forests touch the Wind<br><br>
Not hoping for his notice vast<br>
But nearer to adore<br>
'Tis Glory's far sufficiency<br>
That makes our trying poor.</p>
