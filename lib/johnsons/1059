<p>Sang from the Heart, Sire,<br>
Dipped my Beak in it,<br>
If the Tune drip too much<br>
Have a tint too Red<br><br>
Pardon the Cochineal —<br>
Suffer the Vermillion —<br>
Death is the Wealth<br>
Of the Poorest Bird.<br><br>
Bear with the Ballad —<br>
Awkward — faltering —<br>
Death twists the strings —<br>
'Twasn't my blame —<br><br>
Pause in your Liturgies —<br>
Wait your Chorals —<br>
While I repeat your<br>
Hallowed name —</p>
