<p>The reticent volcano keeps<br>
His never slumbering plan â€”<br>
Confided are his projects pink<br>
To no precarious man.<br><br>
If nature will not tell the tale<br>
Jehovah told to her<br>
Can human nature not survive<br>
Without a listener?<br><br>
Admonished by her buckled lips<br>
Let every babbler be<br>
The only secret people keep<br>
Is Immortality.</p>
