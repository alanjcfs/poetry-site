<p>"Remember me" implored the Thief!<br>
Oh Hospitality!<br>
My Guest "Today in Paradise"<br>
I give thee guaranty.<br><br>
That Courtesy will fair remain<br>
When the Delight is Dust<br>
With which we cite this mightiest case<br>
Of compensated Trust.<br><br>
Of all we are allowed to hope<br>
But Affidavit stands<br>
That this was due where most we fear<br>
Be unexpected Friends.</p>
