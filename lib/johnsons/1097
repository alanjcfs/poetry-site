<p>Dew — is the Freshet in the Grass —<br>
'Tis many a tiny Mill<br>
Turns unperceived beneath our feet<br>
And Artisan lies still —<br>
<br>
We spy the Forests and the Hills<br>
The Tents to Nature's Show<br>
Mistake the Outside for the in<br>
And mention what we saw.<br>
<br>
Could Commentators on the Sign<br>
Of Nature's Caravan<br>
Obtain "Admission" as a Child<br>
Some Wednesday Afternoon.</p>
