To know if any human eyes were near<br>
To whom he could intrust his wavering gaze,<br>
Until it settled firm on Paradise.<br><br>
To know if he was patient, part content,<br>
Was dying as he thought, or different;<br>
Was it a pleasant day to die,<br>
And did the sunshine face his way?<br><br>
What was his furthest mind, of home, of God,<br>
Or what the distant say<br>
At news that he ceased human nature<br>
On such a day?</p>

<p>And wishes, had he any?<br>
Just his sigh, accented,<br>
Had been legible to me.<br>
And was he confident until<br>
Ill fluttered out in everlasting well?<br><br>
And if he spoke, what name was best,<br>
What first,<br>
What one broke off with<br>
At the drowsiest?<br><br>
Was he afraid, or tranquil?<br>
Might he know<br>
How conscious consciousness could grow,<br>
Till love that was, and love too blest to be,<br>
Meet — and the junction be Eternity?</p>
