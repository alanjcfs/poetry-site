<p>I envy Seas, whereon He rides —<br>
I envy Spokes of Wheels<br>
Of Chariots, that Him convey —<br>
I envy Crooked Hills<br>
<br>
That gaze upon His journey —<br>
How easy All can see<br>
What is forbidden utterly<br>
As Heaven — unto me!<br>
<br>
I envy Nests of Sparrows —<br>
That dot His distant Eaves —<br>
The wealthy Fly, upon His Pane —<br>
The happy — happy Leaves —<br>
<br>
That just abroad His Window<br>
Have Summer's leave to play —<br>
The Ear Rings of Pizarro<br>
Could not obtain for me —<br>
<br>
I envy Light — that wakes Him —<br>
And Bells — that boldly ring<br>
To tell Him it is Noon, abroad —<br>
Myself — be Noon to Him —<br>
<br>
Yet interdict — my Blossom —<br>
And abrogate — my Bee —<br>
Lest Noon in Everlasting Night —<br>
Drop Gabriel — and Me —</p>
