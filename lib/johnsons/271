<p>A solemn thing — it was — I said —<br>
A woman — white — to be —<br>
And wear — if God should count me fit —<br>
Her blameless mystery —<br><br>
A hallowed thing — to drop a life<br>
Into the purple well —<br>
Too plummetless — that it return —<br>
Eternity — until —<br><br>
I pondered how the bliss would look —<br>
And would it feel as big —<br>
When I could take it in my hand —<br>
As hovering — seen — through fog —<br><br>
And then — the size of this "small" life —<br>
The Sages — call it small —<br>
Swelled — like Horizons — in my vest —<br>
And I sneered — softly — "small"!</p>
