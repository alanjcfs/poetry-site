<p>My Faith is larger than the Hills —<br>
So when the Hills decay —<br>
My Faith must take the Purple Wheel<br>
To show the Sun the way —<br><br>
'Tis first He steps upon the Vane —<br>
And then — upon the Hill —<br>
And then abroad the World He go<br>
To do His Golden Will —<br><br>
And if His Yellow feet should miss —<br>
The Bird would not arise —<br>
The Flowers would slumber on their Stems —<br>
No Bells have Paradise —<br><br>
How dare I, therefore, stint a faith<br>
On which so vast depends —<br>
Lest Firmament should fail for me —<br>
The Rivet in the Bands</p>
