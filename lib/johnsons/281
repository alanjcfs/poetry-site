<p>'Tis so appalling — it exhilarates —<br>
So over Horror, it half Captivates —<br>
The Soul stares after it, secure —<br>
A Sepulchre, fears frost, no more —<br><br>
To scan a Ghost, is faint —<br>
But grappling, conquers it —<br>
How easy, Torment, now —<br>
Suspense kept sawing so —<br><br>
The Truth, is Bald, and Cold —<br>
But that will hold —<br>
If any are not sure —<br>
We show them — prayer —<br>
But we, who know,<br>
Stop hoping, now —<br><br>
Looking at Death, is Dying —<br>
Just let go the Breath —<br>
And not the pillow at your Cheek<br>
So Slumbereth —<br><br>
Others, Can wrestle —<br>
Yours, is done —<br>
And so of Woe, bleak dreaded — come,<br>
It sets the Fright at liberty —<br>
And Terror's free —<br>
Gay, Ghastly, Holiday!</p>
