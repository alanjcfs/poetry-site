<p>These are the days when Birds come back —<br>
A very few — a Bird or two —<br>
To take a backward look.<br><br>
These are the days when skies resume<br>
The old — old sophistries of June —<br>
A blue and gold mistake.<br><br>
Oh fraud that cannot cheat the Bee —<br>
Almost thy plausibility<br>
Induces my belief.<br><br>
Till ranks of seeds their witness bear —<br>
And softly thro' the altered air<br>
Hurries a timid leaf.<br><br>
Oh Sacrament of summer days,<br>
Oh Last Communion in the Haze —<br>
Permit a child to join.<br><br>
Thy sacred emblems to partake —<br>
They consecrated bread to take<br>
And thine immortal wine!</p>
