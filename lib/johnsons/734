<p>If He were living — dare I ask —<br>
And how if He be dead —<br>
And so around the Words I went —<br>
Of meeting them — afraid —<br><br>
I hinted Changes — Lapse of Time —<br>
The Surfaces of Years —<br>
I touched with Caution — lest they crack —<br>
And show me to my fears —<br><br>
Reverted to adjoining Lives —<br>
Adroitly turning out<br>
Wherever I suspected Graves —<br>
'Twas prudenter — I thought —<br><br>
And He — I pushed — with sudden force —<br>
In face of the Suspense —<br>
"Was buried" — "Buried"! "He!"<br>
My Life just holds the Trench —</p>
