<p>I think the Hemlock likes to stand<br>
Upon a Marge of Snow —<br>
It suits his own Austerity —<br>
And satisfies an awe<br><br>
That men, must slake in Wilderness —<br>
And in the Desert — cloy —<br>
An instinct for the Hoar, the Bald —<br>
Lapland's — necessity —<br><br>
The Hemlock's nature thrives — on cold —<br>
The Gnash of Northern winds<br>
Is sweetest nutriment — to him —<br>
His best Norwegian Wines —<br><br>
To satin Races — he is nought —<br>
But Children on the Don,<br>
Beneath his Tabernacles, play,<br>
And Dnieper Wrestlers, run.</p>
