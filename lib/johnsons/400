<p>A Tongue — to tell Him I am true!<br>
Its fee — to be of Gold —<br>
Had Nature — in Her monstrous House<br>
A single Ragged Child —<br><br>
To earn a Mine — would run<br>
That Interdicted Way,<br>
And tell Him — Charge thee speak it plain —<br>
That so far — Truth is True?<br><br>
And answer What I do —<br>
Beginning with the Day<br>
That Night — begun —<br>
Nay — Midnight — 'twas —<br>
Since Midnight — happened — say —<br><br>
If once more — Pardon — Boy —<br>
The Magnitude thou may<br>
Enlarge my Message — If too vast<br>
Another Lad — help thee —<br><br>
Thy Pay — in Diamonds — be —<br>
And His — in solid Gold —<br>
Say Rubies — if He hesitate —<br>
My Message — must be told —<br><br>
Say — last I said — was This —<br>
That when the Hills — come down —<br>
And hold no higher than the Plain —<br>
My Bond — have just begun —<br><br>
And when the Heavens — disband —<br>
And Deity conclude —<br>
Then — look for me. Be sure you say —<br>
Least Figure — on the Road —</p>
