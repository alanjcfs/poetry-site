<p>"Heaven" — is what I cannot reach!<br>
The Apple on the Tree —<br>
Provided it do hopeless — hang —<br>
That — "Heaven" is — to Me!<br>
<br>
The Color, on the Cruising Cloud —<br>
The interdicted Land —<br>
Behind the Hill — the House behind —<br>
There — Paradise — is found!<br>
<br>
Her teasing Purples — Afternoons —<br>
The credulous — decoy —<br>
Enamored — of the Conjurer —<br>
That spurned us — Yesterday!</p>
