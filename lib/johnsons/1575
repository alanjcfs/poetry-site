<p>The Bat is dun, with wrinkled Wings —<br>
Like fallow Article —<br>
And not a song pervade his Lips —<br>
Or none perceptible.<br><br>
His small Umbrella quaintly halved<br>
Describing in the Air<br>
An Arc alike inscrutable<br>
Elate Philosopher.<br><br>
Deputed from what Firmament —<br>
Of what Astute Abode —<br>
Empowered with what Malignity<br>
Auspiciously withheld —<br><br>
To his adroit Creator<br>
Acribe no less the praise —<br>
Beneficent, believe me,<br>
His Eccentricities —</p>
