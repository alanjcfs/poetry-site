<p>The Guest is gold and crimson —<br>
An Opal guest and gray —<br>
Of Ermine is his doublet —<br>
His Capuchin gay —<br><br>
He reaches town at nightfall —<br>
He stops at every door —<br>
Who looks for him at morning<br>
I pray him too — explore<br>
The Lark's pure territory —<br>
Or the Lapwing's shore!</p>
