<p>In Winter in my Room<br>
I came upon a Worm —<br>
Pink, lank and warm —<br>
But as he was a worm<br>
And worms presume<br>
Not quite with him at home —<br>
Secured him by a string<br>
To something neighboring<br>
And went along.<br><br>
A Trifle afterward<br>
A thing occurred<br>
I'd not believe it if I heard<br>
But state with creeping blood —<br>
A snake with mottles rare<br>
Surveyed my chamber floor<br>
In feature as the worm before<br>
But ringed with power —<br><br>
The very string with which<br>
I tied him — too<br>
When he was mean and new<br>
That string was there —<br><br>
I shrank — "How fair you are"!<br>
Propitiation's claw —<br>
"Afraid," he hissed<br>
"Of me"?<br>
"No cordiality" —<br>
He fathomed me —<br>
Then to a Rhythm Slim<br>
Secreted in his Form<br>
As Patterns swim<br>
Projected him.<br><br>
That time I flew<br>
Both eyes his way<br>
Lest he pursue<br>
Nor ever ceased to run<br>
Till in a distant Town<br>
Towns on from mine<br>
I set me down<br>
This was a dream.</p>
