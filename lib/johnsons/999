<p>Superfluous were the Sun<br>
When Excellence be dead<br>
He were superfluous every Day<br>
For every Day be said<br><br>
That syllable whose Faith<br>
Just saves it from Despair<br>
And whose "I'll meet You" hesitates<br>
If Love inquire "Where"?<br><br>
Upon His dateless Fame<br>
Our Periods may lie<br>
As Stars that drop anonymous<br>
From an abundant sky.</p>
