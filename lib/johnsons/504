<p>You know that Portrait in the Moon —<br>
So tell me who 'tis like —<br>
The very Brow — the stooping eyes —<br>
A fog for — Say — Whose Sake?<br><br>
The very Pattern of the Cheek —<br>
It varies — in the Chin —<br>
But — Ishmael — since we met — 'tis long —<br>
And fashions — intervene —<br><br>
When Moon's at full — 'Tis Thou — I say —<br>
My lips just hold the name —<br>
When crescent — Thou art worn — I note —<br>
But — there — the Golden Same —<br><br>
And when — Some Night — Bold — slashing Clouds<br>
Cut Thee away from Me —<br>
That's easier — than the other film<br>
That glazes Holiday —</p>
