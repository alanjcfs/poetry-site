<p>Faith — is the Pierless Bridge<br>
Supporting what We see<br>
Unto the Scene that We do not —<br>
Too slender for the eye<br><br>
It bears the Soul as bold<br>
As it were rocked in Steel<br>
With Arms of Steel at either side —<br>
It joins — behind the Veil<br><br>
To what, could We presume<br>
The Bridge would cease to be<br>
To Our far, vacillating Feet<br>
A first Necessity.</p>
