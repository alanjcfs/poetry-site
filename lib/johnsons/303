<p>The Soul selects her own Society —<br>
Then — shuts the Door —<br>
To her divine Majority —<br>
Present no more —<br><br>
Unmoved — she notes the Chariots — pausing —<br>
At her low Gate —<br>
Unmoved — an Emperor be kneeling<br>
Upon her Mat —<br><br>
I've known her — from an ample nation —<br>
Choose One —<br>
Then — close the Valves of her attention —<br>
Like Stone —</p>
