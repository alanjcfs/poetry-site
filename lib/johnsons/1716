<p>Death is like the insect<br>
Menacing the tree,<br>
Competent to kill it,<br>
But decoyed may be.<br>
<br>
Bait it with the balsam,<br>
Seek it with the saw,<br>
Baffle, if it cost you<br>
Everything you are.<br>
<br>
Then, if it have burrowed<br>
Out of reach of skill â€”<br>
Wring the tree and leave it,<br>
'Tis the vermin's will.</p>
