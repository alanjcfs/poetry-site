<p>Empty my Heart, of Thee —<br>
Its single Artery —<br>
Begin, and leave Thee out —<br>
Simply Extinction's Date —<br><br>
Much Billow hath the Sea —<br>
One Baltic — They —<br>
Subtract Thyself, in play,<br>
And not enough of me<br>
Is left — to put away —<br>
"Myself" meanth Thee —<br><br>
Erase the Root — no Tree —<br>
Thee — then — no me —<br>
The Heavens stripped —<br>
Eternity's vast pocket, picked —</p>
