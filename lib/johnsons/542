<p>I had no Cause to be awake —<br>
My Best — was gone to sleep —<br>
And Morn a new politeness took —<br>
And failed to wake them up —<br><br>
But called the others — clear —<br>
And passed their Curtains by —<br>
Sweet Morning — when I oversleep —<br>
Knock — Recollect — to Me —<br><br>
I looked at Sunrise — Once —<br>
And then I looked at Them —<br>
And wishfulness in me arose —<br>
For Circumstance the same —<br><br>
'Twas such an Ample Peace —<br>
It could not hold a Sigh —<br>
'Twas Sabbath — with the Bells divorced —<br>
'Twas Sunset — all the Day —<br><br>
So choosing but a Gown —<br>
And taking but a Prayer —<br>
The only Raiment I should need —<br>
I struggled — and was There —</p>
