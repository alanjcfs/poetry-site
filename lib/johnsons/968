<p>Fitter to see Him, I may be<br>
For the long Hindrance — Grace — to Me —<br>
With Summers, and with Winters, grow,<br>
Some passing Year — A trait bestow<br><br>
To make Me fairest of the Earth —<br>
The Waiting — then — will seem so worth<br>
I shall impute with half a pain<br>
The blame that I was chosen — then —<br><br>
Time to anticipate His Gaze —<br>
It's first — Delight — and then — Surprise —<br>
The turning o'er and o'er my face<br>
For Evidence it be the Grace —<br><br>
He left behind One Day — So less<br>
He seek Conviction, That — be This —<br><br>
I only must not grow so new<br>
That He'll mistake — and ask for me<br>
Of me — when first unto the Door<br>
I go — to Elsewhere go no more —<br><br>
I only must not change so fair<br>
He'll sigh — "The Other — She — is Where?"<br>
The Love, tho', will array me right<br>
I shall be perfect — in His sight —<br><br>
If He perceive the other Truth —<br>
Upon an Excellenter Youth —<br><br>
How sweet I shall not lack in Vain —<br>
But gain — thro' loss — Through Grief — obtain —<br>
The Beauty that reward Him best —<br>
The Beauty of Demand — at Rest —</p>
