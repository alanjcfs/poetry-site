<p>They leave us with the Infinite.<br>
But He — is not a man —<br>
His fingers are the size of fists —<br>
His fists, the size of men —<br><br>
And whom he foundeth, with his Arm<br>
As Himmaleh, shall stand —<br>
Gibraltar's Everlasting Shoe<br>
Poised lightly on his Hand,<br><br>
So trust him, Comrade —<br>
You for you, and I, for you and me<br>
Eternity is ample,<br>
And quick enough, if true.</p>
