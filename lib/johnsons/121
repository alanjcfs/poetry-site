<p>As Watchers hang upon the East,<br>
As Beggars revel at a feast<br>
By savory Fancy spread —<br>
As brooks in deserts babble sweet<br>
On ear too far for the delight,<br>
Heaven beguiles the tired.<br><br>
As that same watcher, when the East<br>
Opens the lid of Amethyst<br>
And lets the morning go —<br>
That Beggar, when an honored Guest,<br>
Those thirsty lips to flagons pressed,<br>
Heaven to us, if true.</p>
