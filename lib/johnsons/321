<p>Of all the Sounds despatched abroad,<br>
There's not a Charge to me<br>
Like that old measure in the Boughs —<br>
That phraseless Melody —<br>
The Wind does — working like a Hand,<br>
Whose fingers Comb the Sky —<br>
Then quiver down — with tufts of Tune —<br>
Permitted Gods, and me —<br>
<br>
Inheritance, it is, to us —<br>
Beyond the Art to Earn —<br>
Beyond the trait to take away<br>
By Robber, since the Gain<br>
Is gotten not of fingers —<br>
And inner than the Bone —<br>
Hid golden, for the whole of Days,<br>
And even in the Urn,<br>
I cannot vouch the merry Dust<br>
Do not arise and play<br>
In some odd fashion of its own,<br>
Some quainter Holiday,<br>
When Winds go round and round in Bands —<br>
And thrum upon the door,<br>
And Birds take places, overhead,<br>
To bear them Orchestra.<br>
<br>
I crave Him grace of Summer Boughs,<br>
If such an Outcast be —<br>
Who never heard that fleshless Chant —<br>
Rise — solemn — on the Tree,<br>
As if some Caravan of Sound<br>
Off Deserts, in the Sky,<br>
Had parted Rank,<br>
Then knit, and swept —<br>
In Seamless Company —</p>
