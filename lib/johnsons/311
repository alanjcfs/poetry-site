<p>It sifts from Leaden Sieves —<br>
It powders all the Wood.<br>
It fills with Alabaster Wool<br>
The Wrinkles of the Road —<br>
<br>
It makes an Even Face<br>
Of Mountain, and of Plain —<br>
Unbroken Forehead from the East<br>
Unto the East again —<br>
<br>
It reaches to the Fence —<br>
It wraps it Rail by Rail<br>
Till it is lost in Fleeces —<br>
It deals Celestial Vail<br>
<br>
To Stump, and Stack — and Stem —<br>
A Summer's empty Room —<br>
Acres of Joints, where Harvests were,<br>
Recordless, but for them—<br>
<br>
It Ruffles Wrists of Posts<br>
As Ankles of a Queen —<br>
Then stills its Artisans — like Ghosts —<br>
Denying they have been —</p>
