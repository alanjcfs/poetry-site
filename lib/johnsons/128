<p>Bring me the sunset in a cup,<br>
Reckon the morning's flagons up<br>
And say how many Dew,<br>
Tell me how far the morning leaps —<br>
Tell me what time the weaver sleeps<br>
Who spun the breadth of blue!<br>
<br>
Write me how many notes there be<br>
In the new Robin's ecstasy<br>
Among astonished boughs —<br>
How many trips the Tortoise makes —<br>
How many cups the Bee partakes,<br>
The Debauchee of Dews!<br>
<br>
Also, who laid the Rainbow's piers,<br>
Also, who leads the docile spheres<br>
By withes of supple blue?<br>
Whose fingers string the stalactite —<br>
Who counts the wampum of the night<br>
To see that none is due?<br>
<br>
Who built this little Alban House<br>
And shut the windows down so close<br>
My spirit cannot see?<br>
Who'll let me out some gala day<br>
With implements to fly away,<br>
Passing Pomposity?</p>
