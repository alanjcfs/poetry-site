<p>Tho' my destiny be Fustian —<br>
Hers be damask fine —<br>
Tho' she wear a silver apron —<br>
I, a less divine —<br><br>
Still, my little Gypsy being<br>
I would far prefer,<br>
Still, my little sunburnt bosom<br>
To her Rosier,<br><br>
For, when Frosts, their punctual fingers<br>
On her forehead lay,<br>
You and I, and Dr. Holland,<br>
Bloom Eternally!<br><br>
Roses of a steadfast summer<br>
In a steadfast land,<br>
Where no Autumn lifts her pencil —<br>
And no Reapers stand!</p>
