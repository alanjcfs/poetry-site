<p>It don't sound so terrible — quite — as it did —<br>
I run it over — "Dead", Brain, "Dead."<br>
Put it in Latin — left of my school —<br>
Seems it don't shriek so — under rule.<br>
<br>
Turn it, a little — full in the face<br>
A Trouble looks bitterest —<br>
Shift it — just —<br>
Say "When Tomorrow comes this way —<br>
I shall have waded down one Day."<br>
<br>
I suppose it will interrupt me some<br>
Till I get accustomed — but then the Tomb<br>
Like other new Things — shows largest — then —<br>
And smaller, by Habit —<br>
<br>
It's shrewder then<br>
Put the Thought in advance — a Year —<br>
How like "a fit" — then —<br>
Murder — wear!</p>
