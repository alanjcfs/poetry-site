<p>There is a morn by men unseen -<br>
Whose maids opon remoter green<br>
Keep their seraphic May -<br>
And all day long, with dance and game,<br>
And gambo! I may never name -<br>
Employ their holiday.<br><br>
Here to light measure, move the feet<br>
Which walk no more the village street -<br>
Nor by the wood are found -<br>
Here are the birds that sought the sun<br>
When last year's distaff idle hung<br>
And summer's brows were bound.<br><br>
Ne'er saw I such a wondrous scene -<br>
Ne'er such a ring on such a green -<br>
Nor so serene array -<br>
As if the stars some summer night<br>
Should swing their cups of Chrysolite -<br>
And revel till the day -<br><br>
Like thee to dance - like thee to sing -<br>
People opon that mystic green -<br>
I ask, each new May morn.<br>
I wait thy far - fantastic bells -<br>
Announcing me in other dells -<br>
Unto the different dawn!</p>

<p>There is a morn by men unseen —<br>
Whose maids upon remoter green<br>
Keep their Seraphic May —<br>
And all day long, with dance and game,<br>
And gambol I may never name —<br>
Employ their holiday.<br><br>
Here to light measure, move the feet<br>
Which walk no more the village street —<br>
Nor by the wood are found —<br>
Here are the birds that sought the sun<br>
When last year's distaff idle hung<br>
And summer's brows were bound.<br><br>
Ne'er saw I such a wondrous scene —<br>
Ne'er such a ring on such a green —<br>
Nor so serene array —<br>
As if the stars some summer night<br>
Should swing their cups of Chrysolite —<br>
And revel till the day —<br><br>
Like thee to dance — like thee to sing —<br>
People upon the mystic green —<br>
I ask, each new May Morn.<br>
I wait thy far, fantastic bells —<br>
Unto the different dawn!</p>
