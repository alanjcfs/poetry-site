<p>The first Day that I was a Life<br>
I recollect it — How still —<br>
That last Day that I was a Life<br>
I recollect it — as well —<br><br>
'Twas stiller — though the first<br>
Was still —<br>
"Twas empty — but the first<br>
Was full —<br><br>
This — was my finallest Occasion —<br>
But then<br>
My tenderer Experiment<br>
Toward Men —<br><br>
"Which choose I"?<br>
That — I cannot say —<br>
"Which choose They"?<br>
Question Memory!</p>
