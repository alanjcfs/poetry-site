<p>If He dissolve — then — there is nothing — more —<br>
Eclipse — at Midnight —<br>
It was dark — before —<br>
Sunset — at Easter —<br>
Blindness — on the Dawn —<br>
Faint Star of Bethlehem —<br>
Gone down!<br>
<br>
Would but some God — inform Him —<br>
Or it be too late!<br>
Say — that the pulse just lisps —<br>
The Chariots wait —<br>
<br>
Say — that a little life — for His —<br>
Is leaking — red —<br>
His little Spaniel — tell Him!<br>
Will He heed?</p>
