<p>Some keep the Sabbath going to Church —<br>
I keep it, staying at Home —<br>
With a Bobolink for a Chorister —<br>
And an Orchard, for a Dome —<br><br>
Some keep the Sabbath in Surplice —<br>
I just wear my Wings —<br>
And instead of tolling the Bell, for Church,<br>
Our little Sexton — sings.<br><br>
God preaches, a noted Clergyman —<br>
And the sermon is never long,<br>
So instead of getting to Heaven, at last —<br>
I'm going, all along.</p>
