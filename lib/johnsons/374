<p>I went to Heaven —<br>
'Twas a small Town —<br>
Lit — with a Ruby —<br>
Lathed — with Down —<br>
<br>
Stiller — than the fields<br>
At the full Dew —<br>
Beautiful — as Pictures —<br>
No Man drew.<br>
People — like the Moth —<br>
Of Mechlin — frames —<br>
Duties — of Gossamer —<br>
And Eider — names —<br>
Almost — contented —<br>
I — could be —<br>
'Mong such unique<br>
Society —</p>
