<p>Like Flowers, that heard the news of Dews,<br>
But never deemed the dripping prize<br>
Awaited their — low Brows —<br>
Or Bees — that thought the Summer's name<br>
Some rumor of Delirium,<br>
No Summer — could — for Them —<br><br>
Or Arctic Creatures, dimly stirred —<br>
By Tropic Hint — some Travelled Bird<br>
Imported to the Wood —<br><br>
Or Wind's bright signal to the Ear —<br>
Making that homely, and severe,<br>
Contented, known, before —<br><br>
The Heaven — unexpected come,<br>
To Lives that thought the Worshipping<br>
A too presumptuous Psalm —</p>
