<p>What I see not, I better see —<br>
Through Faith — my Hazel Eye<br>
Has periods of shutting —<br>
But, No lid has Memory —<br><br>
For frequent, all my sense obscured<br>
I equally behold<br>
As someone held a light unto<br>
The Features so beloved —-<br><br>
And I arise — and in my Dream —<br>
Do Thee distinguished Grace —<br>
Till jealous Daylight interrupt —<br>
And mar thy perfectness —</p>
