<p>Through those old Grounds of memory,<br>
The sauntering alone<br>
Is a divine intemperance<br>
A prudent man would shun.<br>
Of liquors that are vended<br>
'Tis easy to beware<br>
But statutes do not meddle<br>
With the internal bar.<br>
Pernicious as the sunset<br>
Permitting to pursue<br>
But impotent to gather,<br>
The tranquil perfidy<br>
Alloys our firmer moments<br>
With that severest gold<br>
Convenient to the longing<br>
But otherwise withheld.</p>
