<p>Alone and in a Circumstance<br>
Reluctant to be told<br>
A spider on my reticence<br>
Assiduously crawled<br><br>
And so much more at Home than I<br>
Immediately grew<br>
I felt myself a visitor<br>
And hurriedly withdrew<br><br>
Revisiting my late abode<br>
With articles of claim<br>
I found it quietly assumed<br>
As a Gymnasium<br>
Where Tax asleep and Title off<br>
The inmates of the Air<br>
Perpetual presumption took<br>
As each were special Heir —<br>
If any strike me on the street<br>
I can return the Blow —<br>
If any take my property<br>
According to the Law<br>
The Statute is my Learned friend<br>
But what redress can be<br>
For an offense nor here nor there<br>
So not in Equity —<br>
That Larceny of time and mind<br>
That marrow of the Day<br>
By spider, or forbid it Lord<br>
That I should specify.</p>
