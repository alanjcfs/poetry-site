<p>The Wind didn't come from the Orchard — today —<br>
Further than that —<br>
Nor stop to play with the Hay —<br>
Nor joggle a Hat —<br>
He's a transitive fellow — very —<br>
Rely on that —<br><br>
If He leave a Bur at the door<br>
We know He has climbed a Fir —<br>
But the Fir is Where — Declare —<br>
Were you ever there?<br><br>
If He brings Odors of Clovers —<br>
And that is His business — not Ours —<br>
Then He has been with the Mowers —<br>
Whetting away the Hours<br>
To sweet pauses of Hay —<br>
His Way — of a June Day —<br><br>
If He fling Sand, and Pebble —<br>
Little Boys Hats — and Stubble —<br>
With an occasional Steeple —<br>
And a hoarse "Get out of the way, I say,"<br>
Who'd be the fool to stay?<br>
Would you — Say —<br>
Would you be the fool to stay?</p>
