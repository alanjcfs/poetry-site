<p>"And with what body do they come?" —<br>
Then they do come — Rejoice!<br>
What Door — What Hour — Run — run — My Soul!<br>
Illuminate the House!<br><br>
"Body!" Then real — a Face and Eyes —<br>
To know that it is them!<br>
Paul knew the Man that knew the News —<br>
He passed through Bethlehem —</p>
