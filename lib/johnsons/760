<p>Most she touched me by her muteness —<br>
Most she won me by the way<br>
She presented her small figure —<br>
Plea itself — for Charity —<br><br>
Were a Crumb my whole possession —<br>
Were there famine in the land —<br>
Were it my resource from starving —<br>
Could I such a plea withstand —<br><br>
Not upon her knee to thank me<br>
Sank this Beggar from the Sky —<br>
But the Crumb partook — departed —<br>
And returned On High —<br><br>
I supposed — when sudden<br>
Such a Praise began<br>
'Twas as Space sat singing<br>
To herself — and men —<br><br>
'Twas the Winged Beggar —<br>
Afterward I learned<br>
To her Benefactor<br>
Making Gratitude</p>
