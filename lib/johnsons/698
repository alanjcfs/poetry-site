<p>Life — is what we make of it —<br>
Death — we do not know —<br>
Christ's acquaintance with Him<br>
Justify Him — though —<br><br>
He — would trust no stranger —<br>
Other — could betray —<br>
Just His own endorsement —<br>
That — sufficeth Me —<br><br>
All the other Distance<br>
He hath traversed first —<br>
No New Mile remaineth —<br>
Far as Paradise —<br><br>
His sure foot preceding —<br>
Tender Pioneer —<br>
Base must be the Coward<br>
Dare not venture — now —</p>
