<p>What would I give to see his face?<br>
I'd give — I'd give my life — of course —<br>
But that is not enough!<br>
Stop just a minute — let me think!<br>
I'd give my biggest Bobolink!<br>
That makes two — Him — and Life!<br>
You know who "June" is —<br>
I'd give her —<br>
Roses a day from Zanzibar —<br>
And Lily tubes — like Wells —<br>
Bees — by the furlong —<br>
Straits of Blue<br>
Navies of Butterflies — sailed thro' —<br>
And dappled Cowslip Dells —<br><br>
Then I have "shares" in Primrose "Banks" —<br>
Daffodil Dowries — spicy "Stocks" —<br>
Dominions — broad as Dew —<br>
Bags of Doublons — adventurous Bees<br>
Brought me — from firmamental seas —<br>
And Purple — from Peru —<br><br>
Now — have I bought it —<br>
"Shylock"? Say!<br>
Sign me the Bond!<br>
"I vow to pay<br>
To Her — who pledges this —<br>
One hour — of her Sovereign's face"!<br>
Ecstatic Contract!<br>
Niggard Grace!<br>
My Kingdom's worth of Bliss!</p>
