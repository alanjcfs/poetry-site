<p>Renunciation — is a piercing Virtue —<br>
The letting go<br>
A Presence — for an Expectation —<br>
Not now —<br>
The putting out of Eyes —<br>
Just Sunrise —<br>
Lest Day —<br>
Day's Great Progenitor —<br>
Outvie<br>
Renunciation — is the Choosing<br>
Against itself —<br>
Itself to justify<br>
Unto itself —<br>
When larger function —<br>
Make that appear —<br>
Smaller — that Covered Vision — Here —</p>
