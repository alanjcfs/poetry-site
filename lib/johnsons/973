<p>'Twas awkward, but it fitted me —<br>
An Ancient fashioned Heart —<br>
Its only lore — its Steadfastness —<br>
In Change — unerudite —<br><br>
It only moved as do the Suns —<br>
For merit of Return —<br>
Or Birds — confirmed perpetual<br>
By Alternating Zone —<br><br>
I only have it not Tonight<br>
In its established place —<br>
For technicality of Death —<br>
Omitted in the Lease —</p>
