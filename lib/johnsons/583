<p>A Toad, can die of Light —<br>
Death is the Common Right<br>
Of Toads and Men —<br>
Of Earl and Midge<br>
The privilege —<br>
Why swagger, then?<br>
The Gnat's supremacy is large as Thine —<br><br>
Life — is a different Thing —<br>
So measure Wine —<br>
Naked of Flask — Naked of Cask —<br>
Bare Rhine —<br>
Which Ruby's mine?</p>
