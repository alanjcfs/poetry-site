<p>Severer Service of myself<br>
I — hastened to demand<br>
To fill the awful Vacuum<br>
Your life had left behind —<br><br>
I worried Nature with my Wheels<br>
When Hers had ceased to run —<br>
When she had put away Her Work<br>
My own had just begun.<br><br>
I strove to weary Brain and Bone —<br>
To harass to fatigue<br>
The glittering Retinue of nerves —<br>
Vitality to clog<br><br>
To some dull comfort Those obtain<br>
Who put a Head away<br>
They knew the Hair to —<br>
And forget the color of the Day —<br><br>
Affliction would not be appeased —<br>
The Darkness braced as firm<br>
As all my stratagem had been<br>
The Midnight to confirm —<br><br>
No Drug for Consciousness — can be —<br>
Alternative to die<br>
Is Nature's only Pharmacy<br>
For Being's Malady —</p>
