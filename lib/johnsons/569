<p>I reckon — when I count at all —<br>
First — Poets — Then the Sun —<br>
Then Summer — Then the Heaven of God —<br>
And then — the List is done —<br><br>
But, looking back — the First so seems<br>
To Comprehend the Whole —<br>
The Others look a needless Show —<br>
So I write — Poets — All —<br><br>
Their Summer — lasts a Solid Year —<br>
They can afford a Sun<br>
The East — would deem extravagant —<br>
And if the Further Heaven —<br><br>
Be Beautiful as they prepare<br>
For Those who worship Them —<br>
It is too difficult a Grace —<br>
To justify the Dream —</p>
