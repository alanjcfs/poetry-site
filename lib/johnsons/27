<p>Morns like these - we parted<br>
Noons like these - she rose!<br>
Fluttering first - then firmer<br>
To her fair repose -<br>
Never did she lisp it<br>
And 'twas not for <i>me</i> -<br>
She was mute for transport<br>
I, for agony!<br>
Till the evening nearing<br>
One the shutters drew -<br>
Quick! a sharper rustling!<br>
And this linnet flew!</p>
