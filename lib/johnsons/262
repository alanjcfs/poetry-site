<p>The lonesome for they know not What —<br>
The Eastern Exiles — be —<br>
Who strayed beyond the Amber line<br>
Some madder Holiday —<br><br>
And ever since — the purple Moat<br>
They strive to climb — in vain —<br>
As Birds — that tumble from the clouds<br>
Do fumble at the strain —<br><br>
The Blessed Ether — taught them —<br>
Some Transatlantic Morn —<br>
When Heaven — was too common — to miss —<br>
Too sure — to dote upon!</p>
