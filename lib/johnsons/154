<p>Except to Heaven, she is nought.<br>
Except for Angels — lone.<br>
Except to some wide-wandering Bee<br>
A flower superfluous blown.<br><br>
Except for winds — provincial.<br>
Except by Butterflies<br>
Unnoticed as a single dew<br>
That on the Acre lies.<br><br>
The smallest Housewife in the grass,<br>
Yet take her from the Lawn<br>
And somebody has lost the face<br>
That made Existence — Home!</p>
