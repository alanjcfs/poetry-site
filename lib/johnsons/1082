<p>Revolution is the Pod<br>
Systems rattle from<br>
When the Winds of Will are stirred<br>
Excellent is Bloom<br><br>
But except its Russet Base<br>
Every Summer be<br>
The Entomber of itself,<br>
So of Liberty â€”<br><br>
Left inactive on the Stalk<br>
All its Purple fled<br>
Revolution shakes it for<br>
Test if it be dead.</p>
