<p>Do People moulder equally,<br>
They bury, in the Grave?<br>
I do believe a Species<br>
As positively live<br>
<br>
As I, who testify it<br>
Deny that I — am dead —<br>
And fill my Lungs, for Witness —<br>
From Tanks — above my Head —<br>
<br>
I say to you, said Jesus —<br>
That there be standing here —<br>
A Sort, that shall not taste of Death —<br>
If Jesus was sincere —<br>
<br>
I need no further Argue —<br>
That statement of the Lord<br>
Is not a controvertible —<br>
He told me, Death was dead —</p>
