<p>Her final Summer was it —<br>
And yet We guessed it not —<br>
If tenderer industriousness<br>
Pervaded Her, We thought<br><br>
A further force of life<br>
Developed from within —<br>
When Death lit all the shortness up<br>
It made the hurry plain —<br><br>
We wondered at our blindness<br>
When nothing was to see<br>
But Her Carrara Guide post —<br>
At Our Stupidity —<br><br>
When duller than our dullness<br>
The Busy Darling lay —<br>
So busy was she — finishing —<br>
So leisurely — were We —</p>
