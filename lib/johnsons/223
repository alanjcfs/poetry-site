<p>I Came to buy a smile — today —<br>
But just a single smile —<br>
The smallest one upon your face<br>
Will suit me just as well —<br>
The one that no one else would miss<br>
It shone so very small —<br>
I'm pleading at the "counter" — sir —<br>
Could you afford to sell —<br>
I've Diamonds — on my fingers —<br>
You know what Diamonds are?<br>
I've Rubies — live the Evening Blood —<br>
And Topaz — like the star!<br>
'Twould be "a Bargain" for a Jew!<br>
Say — may I have it — Sir?</p>
