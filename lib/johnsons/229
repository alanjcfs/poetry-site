<p>A Burdock — clawed my Gown —<br>
Not Burdock's — blame —<br>
But mine —<br>
Who went too near<br>
The Burdock's Den —<br><br>
A Bog — affronts my shoe —<br>
What else have Bogs — to do —<br>
The only Trade they know —<br>
The splashing Men!<br>
Ah, pity — then!<br><br>
'Tis Minnows can despise!<br>
The Elephant's — calm eyes<br>
Look further on!</p>
