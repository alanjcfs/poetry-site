<p>Tie the Strings to my Life, My Lord,<br>
Then, I am ready to go!<br>
Just a look at the Horses —<br>
Rapid! That will do!<br><br>
Put me in on the firmest side —<br>
So I shall never fall —<br>
For we must ride to the Judgment —<br>
And it's partly, down Hill —<br><br>
But never I mind the steeper —<br>
And never I mind the Sea —<br>
Held fast in Everlasting Race —<br>
By my own Choice, and Thee —<br><br>
Goodbye to the Life I used to live —<br>
And the World I used to know —<br>
And kiss the Hills, for me, just once —<br>
Then — I am ready to go!</p>
