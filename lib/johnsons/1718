<p>Drowning is not so pitiful<br>
As the attempt to rise<br>
Three times, 'tis said, a sinking man<br>
Comes up to face the skies,<br>
And then declines forever<br>
To that abhorred abode,<br>
Where hope and he part company â€”<br>
For he is grasped of God.<br>
The Maker's cordial visage,<br>
However good to see,<br>
Is shunned, we must admit it,<br>
Like an adversity.</p>
