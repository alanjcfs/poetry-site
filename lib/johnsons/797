<p>By my Window have I for Scenery<br>
Just a Sea — with a Stem —<br>
If the Bird and the Farmer — deem it a "Pine" —<br>
The Opinion will serve — for them —<br>
<br>
It has no Port, nor a "Line" — but the Jays —<br>
That split their route to the Sky —<br>
Or a Squirrel, whose giddy Peninsula<br>
May be easier reached — this way —<br>
<br>
For Inlands — the Earth is the under side —<br>
And the upper side — is the Sun —<br>
And its Commerce — if Commerce it have —<br>
Of Spice — I infer from the Odors borne —<br>
<br>
Of its Voice — to affirm — when the Wind is within —<br>
Can the Dumb — define the Divine?<br>
The Definition of Melody — is —<br>
That Definition is none —<br>
<br>
It — suggests to our Faith —<br>
They — suggest to our Sight —<br>
When the latter — is put away<br>
I shall meet with Conviction I somewhere met<br>
That Immortality —<br>
<br>
Was the Pine at my Window a "Fellow<br>
Of the Royal" Infinity?<br>
Apprehensions — are God's introductions —<br>
To be hallowed — accordingly —</p>
