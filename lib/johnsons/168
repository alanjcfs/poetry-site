<p>If the foolish, call them "flowers" —<br>
Need the wiser, tell?<br>
If the Savants "Classify" them<br>
It is just as well!<br>
<br>
Those who read the "Revelations"<br>
Must not criticize<br>
Those who read the same Edition —<br>
With beclouded Eyes!<br>
<br>
Could we stand with that Old "Moses" —<br>
"Canaan" denied —<br>
Scan like him, the stately landscape<br>
On the other side —<br>
<br>
Doubtless, we should deem superfluous<br>
Many Sciences,<br>
Not pursued by learned Angels<br>
In scholastic skies!<br>
<br>
Low amid that glad Belles lettres<br>
Grant that we may stand,<br>
Stars, amid profound Galaxies —<br>
At that grand "Right hand"!</p>
