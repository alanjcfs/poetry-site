<p>When I was small, a Woman died —<br>
Today — her Only Boy<br>
Went up from the Potomac —<br>
His face all Victory<br><br>
To look at her — How slowly<br>
The Seasons must have turned<br>
Till Bullets clipt an Angle<br>
And He passed quickly round —<br><br>
If pride shall be in Paradise —<br>
Ourself cannot decide —<br>
Of their imperial Conduct —<br>
No person testified —<br><br>
But, proud in Apparition —<br>
That Woman and her Boy<br>
Pass back and forth, before my Brain<br>
As even in the sky —<br><br>
I'm confident that Bravoes —<br>
Perpetual break abroad<br>
For Braveries, remote as this<br>
In Scarlet Maryland —</p>
