<p>In Ebon Box, when years have flown<br>
To reverently peer,<br>
Wiping away the velvet dust<br>
Summers have sprinkled there!<br><br>
To hold a letter to the light —<br>
Grown Tawny now, with time —<br>
To con the faded syllables<br>
That quickened us like Wine!<br><br>
Perhaps a Flower's shrivelled check<br>
Among its stores to find —<br>
Plucked far away, some morning —<br>
By gallant — mouldering hand!<br><br>
A curl, perhaps, from foreheads<br>
Our Constancy forgot —<br>
Perhaps, an Antique trinket —<br>
In vanished fashions set!<br><br>
And then to lay them quiet back —<br>
And go about its care —<br>
As if the little Ebon Box<br>
Were none of our affair!</p>
