<p>I am alive — I guess —<br>
The Branches on my Hand<br>
Are full of Morning Glory —<br>
And at my finger's end —<br>
<br>
The Carmine — tingles warm —<br>
And if I hold a Glass<br>
Across my Mouth — it blurs it —<br>
Physician's — proof of Breath —<br>
<br>
I am alive — because<br>
I am not in a Room —<br>
The Parlor — Commonly — it is —<br>
So Visitors may come —<br>
<br>
And lean — and view it sidewise —<br>
And add "How cold — it grew" —<br>
And "Was it conscious — when it stepped<br>
In Immortality?"<br>
<br>
I am alive — because<br>
I do not own a House —<br>
Entitled to myself — precise —<br>
And fitting no one else —<br>
<br>
And marked my Girlhood's name —<br>
So Visitors may know<br>
Which Door is mine — and not mistake —<br>
And try another Key —<br>
<br>
How good — to be alive!<br>
How infinite — to be<br>
Alive — two-fold — The Birth I had —<br>
And this — besides, in — Thee!</p>
