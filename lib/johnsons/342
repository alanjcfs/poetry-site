<p>It will be Summer — eventually.<br>
Ladies — with parasols —<br>
Sauntering Gentlemen — with Canes —<br>
And little Girls — with Dolls —<br><br>
Will tint the pallid landscape —<br>
As 'twere a bright Bouquet —<br>
Thro' drifted deep, in Parian —<br>
The Village lies — today —<br><br>
The Lilacs — bending many a year —<br>
Will sway with purple load —<br>
The Bees — will not despise the tune —<br>
Their Forefathers — have hummed —<br><br>
The Wild Rose — redden in the Bog —<br>
The Aster — on the Hill<br>
Her everlasting fashion — set —<br>
And Covenant Gentians — frill —<br><br>
Till Summer folds her miracle —<br>
As Women — do — their Gown —<br>
Of Priests — adjust the Symbols —<br>
When Sacrament — is done —</p>
