<p>I had a guinea golden —<br>
I lost it in the sand —<br>
And tho' the sum was simple<br>
And pounds were in the land —<br>
Still, had it such a value<br>
Unto my frugal eye —<br>
That when I could not find it —<br>
I sat me down to sigh.<br>
<br>
I had a crimson Robin —<br>
Who sang full many a day<br>
But when the woods were painted,<br>
He, too, did fly away —<br>
<br>
Time brought me other Robins —<br>
Their ballads were the same —<br>
Still, for my missing Troubador<br>
I kept the "house at hame."<br>
<br>
I had a star in heaven —<br>
One "Pleiad" was its name —<br>
And when I was not heeding,<br>
It wandered from the same.<br>
And tho' the skies are crowded —<br>
And all the night ashine —<br>
I do not care about it —<br>
Since none of them are mine.<br>
<br>
My story has a moral —<br>
I have a missing friend —<br>
"Pleiad" its name, and Robin,<br>
And guinea in the sand.<br>
And when this mournful ditty<br>
Accompanied with tear —<br>
Shall meet the eye of traitor<br>
In country far from here —<br>
Grant that repentance solemn<br>
May seize upon his mind —<br>
And he no consolation<br>
Beneath the sun may find.</p>
