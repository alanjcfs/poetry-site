<p>When they come back — if Blossoms do —<br>
I always feel a doubt<br>
If Blossoms can be born again<br>
When once the Art is out —<br><br>
When they begin, if Robins may,<br>
I always had a fear<br>
I did not tell, it was their last Experiment<br>
Last Year,<br><br>
When it is May, if May return,<br>
Had nobody a pang<br>
Lest in a Face so beautiful<br>
He might not look again?<br><br>
If I am there — One does not know<br>
What Party — One may be<br>
Tomorrow, but if I am there<br>
I take back all I say —</p>
