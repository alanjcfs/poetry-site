<p>Dying! To be afraid of thee<br>
One must to thine Artillery<br>
Have left exposed a Friend <br>
Than thine old Arrow is a Shot<br>
Delivered straighter to the Heart<br>
The leaving Love behind.<br>
<br>
Not for itself, the Dust is shy,<br>
But, enemy, Beloved be<br>
Thy Batteries divorce.<br>
Fight sternly in a Dying eye<br>
Two Armies, Love and Certainty<br>
And Love and the Reverse.</p>
