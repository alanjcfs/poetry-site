<p>The Months have ends — the Years — a knot —<br>
No Power can untie<br>
To stretch a little further<br>
A Skein of Misery —<br><br>
The Earth lays back these tired lives<br>
In her mysterious Drawers —<br>
Too tenderly, that any doubt<br>
An ultimate Repose —<br><br>
The manner of the Children —<br>
Who weary of the Day —<br>
Themself — the noisy Plaything<br>
They cannot put away —</p>
