<p>It's easy to invent a Life —<br>
God does it — every Day —<br>
Creation — but the Gambol<br>
Of His Authority —<br><br>
It's easy to efface it —<br>
The thrifty Deity<br>
Could scarce afford Eternity<br>
To Spontaneity —<br><br>
The Perished Patterns murmur —<br>
But His Perturbless Plan<br>
Proceed — inserting Here — a Sun —<br>
There — leaving out a Man —</p>
