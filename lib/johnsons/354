<p>From Cocoon forth a Butterfly<br>
As Lady from her Door<br>
Emerged — a Summer Afternoon —<br>
Repairing Everywhere —<br><br>
Without Design — that I could trace<br>
Except to stray abroad<br>
On Miscellaneous Enterprise<br>
The Clovers — understood —<br><br>
Her pretty Parasol be seen<br>
Contracting in a Field<br>
Where Men made Hay —<br>
Then struggling hard<br>
With an opposing Cloud —<br><br>
Where Parties — Phantom as Herself —<br>
To Nowhere — seemed to go<br>
In purposeless Circumference —<br>
As 'twere a Tropic Show —<br><br>
And notwithstanding Bee — that worked —<br>
And Flower — that zealous blew —<br>
This Audience of Idleness<br>
Disdained them, from the Sky —<br><br>
Till Sundown crept — a steady Tide —<br>
And Men that made the Hay —<br>
And Afternoon — and Butterfly —<br>
Extinguished — in the Sea —</p>
