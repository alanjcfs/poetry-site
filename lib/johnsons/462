<p>Why make it doubt — it hurts it so —<br>
So sick — to guess —<br>
So strong — to know —<br>
So brave — upon its little Bed<br>
To tell the very last They said<br>
Unto Itself — and smile — And shake —<br>
For that dear — distant — dangerous — Sake —<br>
But — the Instead — the Pinching fear<br>
That Something — it did do — or dare —<br>
Offend the Vision — and it flee —<br>
And They no more remember me —<br>
Nor ever turn to tell me why —<br>
Oh, Master, This is Misery —</p>
