<p>How the old Mountains drip with Sunset<br>
How the Hemlocks burn —<br>
How the Dun Brake is draped in Cinder<br>
By the Wizard Sun —<br><br>
How the old Steeples hand the Scarlet<br>
Till the Ball is full —<br>
Have I the lip of the Flamingo<br>
That I dare to tell?<br><br>
Then, how the Fire ebbs like Billows —<br>
Touching all the Grass<br>
With a departing — Sapphire — feature —<br>
As a Duchess passed —<br><br>
How a small Dusk crawls on the Village<br>
Till the Houses blot<br>
And the odd Flambeau, no men carry<br>
Glimmer on the Street —<br><br>
How it is Night — in Nest and Kennel —<br>
And where was the Wood —<br>
Just a Dome of Abyss is Bowing<br>
Into Solitude —<br><br>
These are the Visions flitted Guido —<br>
Titian — never told —<br>
Domenichino dropped his pencil —<br>
Paralyzed, with Gold —</p>
