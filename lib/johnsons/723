<p>It tossed — and tossed —<br>
A little Brig I knew — o'ertook by Blast —<br>
It spun — and spun —<br>
And groped delirious, for Morn —<br><br>
It slipped — and slipped —<br>
As One that drunken — stept —<br>
Its white foot tripped —<br>
Then dropped from sight —<br><br>
Ah, Brig — Good Night<br>
To Crew and You —<br>
The Ocean's Heart too smooth — too Blue —<br>
To break for You —</p>
