<p>The Malay — took the Pearl —<br>
Not — I — the Earl —<br>
I — feared the Sea — too much<br>
Unsanctified — to touch —<br><br>
Praying that I might be<br>
Worthy — the Destiny —<br>
The Swarthy fellow swam —<br>
And bore my Jewel — Home —<br><br>
Home to the Hut! What lot<br>
Had I — the Jewel — got —<br>
Borne on a Dusky Breasty —<br>
I had not deemed a Vest<br>
Of Amber — fit —<br><br>
The Negro never knew<br>
I — wooed it — too —<br>
To gain, or be undone —<br>
Alike to Him — One —</p>
