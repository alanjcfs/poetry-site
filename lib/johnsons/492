<p>Civilization — spurns — the Leopard!<br>
Was the Leopard — bold?<br>
Deserts — never rebuked her Satin —<br>
Ethiop — her Gold —<br>
Tawny — her Customs —<br>
She was Conscious —<br>
Spotted — her Dun Gown —<br>
This was the Leopard's nature — Signor —<br>
Need — a keeper — frown?<br>
<br>
Pity — the Pard — that left her Asia —<br>
Memories — of Palm —<br>
Cannot be stifled — with Narcotic —<br>
Nor suppressed — with Balm —</p>
