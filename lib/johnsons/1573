<p>To the bright east she flies,<br>
Brothers of Paradise<br>
Remit her home,<br>
Without a change of wings,<br>
Or Love's convenient things,<br>
Enticed to come.<br><br>
Fashioning what she is,<br>
Fathoming what she was,<br>
We deem we dream â€”<br>
And that dissolves the days<br>
Through which existence strays<br>
Homeless at home.</p>
