<p>My Portion is Defeat — today —<br>
A paler luck than Victory —<br>
Less Paeans — fewer Bells —<br>
The Drums don't follow Me — with tunes —<br>
Defeat — a somewhat slower — means —<br>
More Arduous than Balls —<br><br>
'Tis populous with Bone and stain —<br>
And Men too straight to stoop again —,<br>
And Piles of solid Moan —<br>
And Chips of Blank — in Boyish Eyes —<br>
And scraps of Prayer —<br>
And Death's surprise,<br>
Stamped visible — in Stone —<br><br>
There's somewhat prouder, over there —<br>
The Trumpets tell it to the Air —<br>
How different Victory<br>
To Him who has it — and the One<br>
Who to have had it, would have been<br>
Contender — to die —</p>
