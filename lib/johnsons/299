<p>Your Riches — taught me — Poverty.<br>
Myself — a Millionaire<br>
In little Wealths, as Girls could boast<br>
Till broad as Buenos Ayre —<br><br>
You drifted your Dominions —<br>
A Different Peru —<br>
And I esteemed All Poverty<br>
For Life's Estate with you —<br><br>
Of Mines, I little know — myself —<br>
But just the names, of Gems —<br>
The Colors of the Commonest —<br>
And scarce of Diadems —<br><br>
So much, that did I meet the Queen —<br>
Her Glory I should know —<br>
But this, must be a different Wealth —<br>
To miss it — beggars so —<br><br>
I'm sure 'tis India — all Day —<br>
To those who look on You —<br>
Without a stint — without a blame,<br>
Might I — but be the Jew —<br><br>
I'm sure it is Golconda —<br>
Beyond my power to deem —<br>
To have a smile for Mine — each Day,<br>
How better, than a Gem!<br><br>
At least, it solaces to know<br>
That there exists — a Gold —<br>
Altho' I prove it, just in time<br>
Its distance — to behold —<br><br>
Its far — far Treasure to surmise —<br>
And estimate the Pearl —<br>
That slipped my simple fingers through —<br>
While just a Girl at School.</p>
