<p>After a hundred years<br>
Nobody knows the Place<br>
Agony that enacted there<br>
Motionless as Peace<br><br>
Weeds triumphant ranged<br>
Strangers strolled and spelled<br>
At the lone Orthography<br>
Of the Elder Dead<br><br>
Winds of Summer Fields<br>
Recollect the way —<br>
Instinct picking up the Key<br>
Dropped by memory —</p>
