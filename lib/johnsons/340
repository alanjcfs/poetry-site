<p>Is Bliss then, such Abyss,<br>
I must not put my foot amiss<br>
For fear I spoil my shoe?<br><br>
I'd rather suit my foot<br>
Than save my Boot —<br>
For yet to buy another Pair<br>
Is possible,<br>
At any store —<br><br>
But Bliss, is sold just once.<br>
The Patent lost<br>
None buy it any more —<br>
Say, Foot, decide the point —<br>
The Lady cross, or not?<br>
Verdict for Boot!</p>
