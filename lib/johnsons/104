<p>Where I have lost, I softer tread —<br>
I sow sweet flower from garden bed —<br>
I pause above that vanished head<br>
And mourn.<br><br>
Whom I have lost, I pious guard<br>
From accent harsh, or ruthless word —<br>
Feeling as if their pillow heard,<br>
Though stone!<br><br>
When I have lost, you'll know by this —<br>
A Bonnet black — A dusk surplice —<br>
A little tremor in my voice Like this!<br><br>
Why, I have lost, the people know<br>
Who dressed in flocks of purest snow<br>
Went home a century ago<br>
Next Bliss!</p>
