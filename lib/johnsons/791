<p>God gave a Loaf to every Bird —<br>
But just a Crumb — to Me —<br>
I dare not eat it — tho' I starve —<br>
My poignant luxury —<br><br>
To own it — touch it —<br>
Prove the feat — that made the Pellet mine —<br>
Too happy — for my Sparrow's chance —<br>
For Ampler Coveting —<br><br>
It might be Famine — all around —<br>
I could not miss an Ear —<br>
Such Plenty smiles upon my Board —<br>
My Garner shows so fair —<br><br>
I wonder how the Rich — may feel —<br>
An Indiaman — An Earl —<br>
I deem that I — with but a Crumb —<br>
Am Sovereign of them all —</p>
