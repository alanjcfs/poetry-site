<p>On this long storm the rainbow rose,<br>
On this late morn the sun<br>
The clouds, like listless elephants,<br>
Horizons straggled down.<br>
<br>
The birds rose smiling in their nests,<br>
The gales indeed were done<br>
Alas! &nbsp;how heedless were the eyes<br>
On whom the summer shone!<br>
<br>
The quiet nonchalance of death<br>
No daybreak can bestir;<br>
The slow archangel's syllables<br>
Must awaken her.</p>
