<p>'Twas Love — not me —<br>
Oh punish — pray —<br>
The Real one died for Thee —<br>
Just Him — not me —<br><br>
Such Guilt — to love Thee — most!<br>
Doom it beyond the Rest —<br>
Forgive it — last —<br>
'Twas base as Jesus — most!<br><br>
Let Justice not mistake —<br>
We Two — looked so alike —<br>
Which was the Guilty Sake —<br>
'Twas Love's — Now Strike!</p>
