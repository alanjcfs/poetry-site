<p>We Cover Thee — Sweet Face —<br>
Not that We tire of Thee —<br>
But that Thyself fatigue of Us —<br>
Remember — as Thou go —<br>
We follow Thee until<br>
Thou notice Us — no more —<br>
And then — reluctant — turn away<br>
To Con Thee o'er and o'er —<br><br>
And blame the scanty love<br>
We were Content to show —<br>
Augmented — Sweet — a Hundred fold —<br>
If Thou would'st take it — now —</p>
