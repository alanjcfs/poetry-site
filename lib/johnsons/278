<p>A shady friend — for Torrid days —<br>
Is easier to find —<br>
Than one of higher temperature<br>
For Frigid — hour of Mind —<br><br>
The Vane a little to the East —<br>
Scares Muslin souls — away —<br>
If Broadcloth Hearts are firmer —<br>
Than those of Organdy —<br><br>
Who is to blame? The Weaver?<br>
Ah, the bewildering thread!<br>
The Tapestries of Paradise<br>
So notelessly — are made!</p>
