<p>How many schemes may die<br>
In one short Afternoon<br>
Entirely unknown<br>
To those they most concern —<br>
The man that was not lost<br>
Because by accident<br>
He varied by a Ribbon's width<br>
From his accustomed route —<br>
The Love that would not try<br>
Because beside the Door<br>
It must be competitions<br>
Some unsuspecting Horse was tied<br>
Surveying his Despair</p>
