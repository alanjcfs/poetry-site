<p>Her — "last Poems" —<br>
Poets — ended —<br>
Silver — perished — with her Tongue —<br>
Not on Record — bubbled other,<br>
Flute — or Woman —<br>
So divine —<br>
Not unto its Summer — Morning<br>
Robin — uttered Half the Tune —<br>
Gushed too free for the Adoring —<br>
From the Anglo-Florentine —<br>
Late — the Praise —<br>
'Tis dull — conferring<br>
On the Head too High to Crown —<br>
Diadem — or Ducal Showing —<br>
Be its Grave — sufficient sign —<br>
Nought — that We — No Poet's Kinsman —<br>
Suffocate — with easy woe —<br>
What, and if, Ourself a Bridegroom —<br>
Put Her down — in Italy?</p>
