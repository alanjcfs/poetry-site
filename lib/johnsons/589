<p>The Night was wide, and furnished scant<br>
With but a single Star —<br>
That often as a Cloud it met —<br>
Blew out itself — for fear —<br><br>
The Wind pursued the little Bush —<br>
And drove away the Leaves<br>
November left — then clambered up<br>
And fretted in the Eaves —<br><br>
No Squirrel went abroad —<br>
A Dog's belated feet<br>
Like intermittent Plush, he heard<br>
Adown the empty Street —<br><br>
To feel if Blinds be fast —<br>
And closer to the fire —<br>
Her little Rocking Chair to draw —<br>
And shiver for the Poor —<br><br>
The Housewife's gentle Task —<br>
How pleasanter — said she<br>
Unto the Sofa opposite —<br>
The Sleet — than May, no Thee —</p>
