<p>I never hear that one is dead<br>
Without the chance of Life<br>
Afresh annihilating me<br>
That mightiest Belief,<br><br>
Too mighty for the Daily mind<br>
That tilling its abyss,<br>
Had Madness, had it once or twice<br>
The yawning Consciousness,<br><br>
Beliefs are Bandaged, like the Tongue<br>
When Terror were it told<br>
In any Tone commensurate<br>
Would strike us instant Dead<br><br>
I do not know the man so bold<br>
He dare in lonely Place<br>
That awful stranger Consciousness<br>
Deliberately face â€”</p>
