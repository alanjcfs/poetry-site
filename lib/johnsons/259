<p>Good Night! Which put the Candle out?<br>
A jealous Zephyr — not a doubt —<br>
Ah, friend, you little knew<br>
How long at that celestial wick<br>
The Angels — labored diligent —<br>
Extinguished — now — for you!<br><br>
It might — have been the Light House spark —<br>
Some Sailor — rowing in the Dark —<br>
Had importuned to see!<br>
It might — have been the waning lamp<br>
That lit the Drummer from the Camp<br>
To purer Reveille!</p>
