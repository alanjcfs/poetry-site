<p>A Solemn thing within the Soul<br>
To feel itself get ripe —<br>
And golden hang — while farther up —<br>
The Maker's Ladders stop —<br>
And in the Orchard far below —<br>
You hear a Being — drop —<br><br>
A Wonderful — to feel the Sun<br>
Still toiling at the Cheek<br>
You thought was finished —<br>
Cool of eye, and critical of Work —<br>
He shifts the stem — a little —<br>
To give your Core — a look —<br><br>
But solemnest — to know<br>
Your chance in Harvest moves<br>
A little nearer — Every Sun<br>
The Single — to some lives.</p>
