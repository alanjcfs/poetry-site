<p>Of Course — I prayed —<br>
And did God Care?<br>
He cared as much as on the Air<br>
A Bird — had stamped her foot —<br>
And cried "Give Me" —<br>
My Reason — Life —<br>
I had not had — but for Yourself —<br>
'Twere better Charity<br>
To leave me in the Atom's Tomb —<br>
Merry, and Nought, and gay, and numb —<br>
Than this smart Misery.</p>
