<p>Will there really be a "Morning"?<br>
Is there such a thing as "Day"?<br>
Could I see it from the mountains<br>
If I were as tall as they?<br><br>
Has it feet like Water lilies?<br>
Has it feathers like a Bird?<br>
Is it brought from famous countries<br>
Of which I have never heard?<br><br>
Oh some Scholar! Oh some Sailor!<br>
Oh some Wise Men from the skies!<br>
Please to tell a little Pilgrim<br>
Where the place called "Morning" lies!</p>
