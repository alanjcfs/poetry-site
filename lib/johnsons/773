<p>Deprived of other Banquet,<br>
I entertained Myself —<br>
At first — a scant nutrition —<br>
An insufficient Loaf —<br>
<br>
But grown by slender addings<br>
To so esteemed a size<br>
'Tis sumptuous enough for me —<br>
And almost to suffice<br>
<br>
A Robin's famine able —<br>
Red Pilgrim, He and I —<br>
A Berry from our table<br>
Reserve — for charity —</p>
