<p>Had I not This, or This, I said,<br>
Appealing to Myself,<br>
In moment of prosperity —<br>
Inadequate — were Life —<br><br>
"Thou hast not Me, nor Me" — it said,<br>
In Moment of Reverse —<br>
"And yet Thou art industrious —<br>
No need — hadst Thou — of us"?<br><br>
My need — was all I had — I said —<br>
The need did not reduce —<br>
Because the food — exterminate —<br>
The hunger — does not cease —<br><br>
But diligence — is sharper —<br>
Proportioned to the Chance —<br>
To feed upon the Retrograde —<br>
Enfeebles — the Advance —</p>
