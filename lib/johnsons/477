<p>No Man can compass a Despair —<br>
As round a Goalless Road<br>
No faster than a Mile at once<br>
The Traveller proceed —<br>
<br>
Unconscious of the Width —<br>
Unconscious that the Sun<br>
Be setting on His progress —<br>
So accurate the One<br>
<br>
At estimating Pain —<br>
Whose own — has just begun —<br>
His ignorance — the Angel<br>
That pilot Him along —</p>
