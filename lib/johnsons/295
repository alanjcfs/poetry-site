<p>Unto like Story — Trouble has enticed me —<br>
How Kinsmen fell —<br>
Brothers and Sister — who preferred the Glory —<br>
And their young will<br>
Bent to the Scaffold, or in Dungeons — chanted —<br>
Till God's full time —<br>
When they let go the ignominy — smiling —<br>
And Shame went still —<br><br>
Unto guessed Crests, my moaning fancy, leads me,<br>
Worn fair<br>
By Heads rejected — in the lower country —<br>
Of honors there —<br>
Such spirit makes her perpetual mention,<br>
That I — grown bold —<br>
Step martial — at my Crucifixion —<br>
As Trumpets — rolled —<br><br>
Feet, small as mine — have marched in Revolution<br>
Firm to the Drum —<br>
Hands — not so stout — hoisted them — in witness —<br>
When Speech went numb —<br>
Let me not shame their sublime deportments —<br>
Drilled bright —<br>
Beckoning — Etruscan invitation —<br>
Toward Light —</p>
