<p>A science — so the Savants say,<br>
"Comparative Anatomy" —<br>
By which a single bone —<br>
Is made a secret to unfold<br>
Of some rare tenant of the mold,<br>
Else perished in the stone —<br><br>
So to the eye prospective led,<br>
This meekest flower of the mead<br>
Upon a winter's day,<br>
Stands representative in gold<br>
Of Rose and Lily, manifold,<br>
And countless Butterfly!</p>
