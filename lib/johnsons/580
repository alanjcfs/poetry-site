<p>I gave myself to Him —<br>
And took Himself, for Pay,<br>
The solemn contract of a Life<br>
Was ratified, this way —<br><br>
The Wealth might disappoint —<br>
Myself a poorer prove<br>
Than this great Purchaser suspect,<br>
The Daily Own — of Love<br><br>
Depreciate the Vision —<br>
But till the Merchant buy —<br>
Still Fable — in the Isles of Spice —<br>
The subtle Cargoes — lie —<br><br>
At least — 'tis Mutual — Risk —<br>
Some — found it — Mutual Gain —<br>
Sweet Debt of Life — Each Night to owe —<br>
Insolvent — every Noon —</p>
