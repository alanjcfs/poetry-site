<p>Death is the supple Suitor<br>
That wins at last â€”<br>
It is a stealthy Wooing<br>
Conducted first<br>
By pallid innuendoes<br>
And dim approach<br>
But brave at last with Bugles<br>
And a bisected Coach<br>
It bears away in triumph<br>
To Troth unknown<br>
And Kindred as responsive<br>
As Porcelain.</p>
