<p>The Merchant of the Picturesque<br>
A Counter has and sales<br>
But is within or negative<br>
Precisely as the calls —<br>
To Children he is small in price<br>
And large in courtesy —<br>
It suits him better than a check<br>
Their artless currency —<br>
Of Counterfeits he is so shy<br>
Do one advance so near<br>
As to behold his ample flight —</p>
