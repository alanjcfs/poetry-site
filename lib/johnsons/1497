<p>Facts by our side are never sudden<br>
Until they look around<br>
And then they scare us like a spectre<br>
Protruding from the Ground —<br><br>
The height of our portentous Neighbor<br>
We never know —<br>
Till summoned to his recognition<br>
By an Adieu —<br><br>
Adieu for whence<br>
The sage cannot conjecture<br>
The bravest die<br>
As ignorant of their resumption<br>
As you or I —</p>
