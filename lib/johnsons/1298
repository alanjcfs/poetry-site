<p>The Mushroom is the Elf of Plants —<br>
At Evening, it is not —<br>
At Morning, in a Truffled Hut<br>
It stop upon a Spot<br><br>
As if it tarried always<br>
And yet its whole Career<br>
Is shorter than a Snake's Delay<br>
And fleeter than a Tare —<br><br>
'Tis Vegetation's Juggler —<br>
The Germ of Alibi —<br>
Doth like a Bubble antedate<br>
And like a Bubble, hie —<br><br>
I feel as if the Grass was pleased<br>
To have it intermit —<br>
This surreptitious scion<br>
Of Summer's circumspect.<br><br>
Had Nature any supple Face<br>
Or could she one contemn —<br>
Had Nature an Apostate —<br>
That Mushroom — it is Him!</p>
