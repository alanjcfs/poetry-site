<p>He told a homely tale<br>
And spotted it with tears —<br>
Upon his infant face was set<br>
The Cicatrice of years —<br><br>
All crumpled was the cheek<br>
No other kiss had known<br>
Than flake of snow, divided with<br>
The Redbreast of the Barn —<br><br>
If Mother — in the Grave —<br>
Or Father — on the Sea —<br>
Or Father in the Firmament —<br>
Or Brethren, had he —<br><br>
If Commonwealth below,<br>
Or Commonwealth above<br>
Have missed a Barefoot Citizen —<br>
I've ransomed it — alive —</p>
