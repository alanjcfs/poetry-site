<p>He gave away his Life —<br>
To Us — Gigantic Sum —<br>
A trifle — in his own esteem —<br>
But magnified — by Fame —<br><br>
Until it burst the Hearts<br>
That fancied they could hold —<br>
When swift it slipped its limit —<br>
And on the Heavens — unrolled —<br><br>
'Tis Ours — to wince — and weep —<br>
And wonder — and decay<br>
By Blossoms gradual process —<br>
He chose — Maturity —<br><br>
And quickening — as we sowed —<br>
Just obviated Bud —<br>
And when We turned to note the Growth —<br>
Broke — perfect — from the Pod —</p>
