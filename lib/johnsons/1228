<p>So much of Heaven has gone from Earth<br>
That there must be a Heaven<br>
If only to enclose the Saints<br>
To Affidavit given.<br><br>
The Missionary to the Mole<br>
Must prove there is a Sky<br>
Location doubtless he would plead<br>
But what excuse have I?<br><br>
Too much of Proof affronts Belief<br>
The Turtle will not try<br>
Unless you leave him â€” then return<br>
And he has hauled away.</p>
