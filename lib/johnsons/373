<p>I'm saying every day<br>
"If I should be a Queen, tomorrow" —<br>
I'd do this way —<br>
And so I deck, a little,<br><br>
If it be, I wake a Bourbon,<br>
None on me, bend supercilious —<br>
With "This was she —<br>
Begged in the Market place —<br>
Yesterday."<br><br>
Court is a stately place —<br>
I've heard men say —<br>
So I loop my apron, against the Majesty<br>
With bright Pins of Buttercup —<br>
That not too plain —<br>
Rank — overtake me —<br><br>
And perch my Tongue<br>
On Twigs of singing — rather high —<br>
But this, might be my brief Term<br>
To qualify —<br><br>
Put from my simple speech all plain word —<br>
Take other accents, as such I heard<br>
Though but for the Cricket — just,<br>
And but for the Bee —<br>
Not in all the Meadow —<br>
One accost me —<br><br>
Better to be ready —<br>
Than did next morn<br>
Meet me in Aragon —<br>
My old Gown — on —<br><br>
And the surprised Air<br>
Rustics — wear —<br>
Summoned — unexpectedly —<br>
To Exeter —</p>
