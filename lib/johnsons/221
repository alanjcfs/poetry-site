<p>It can't be "Summer"!<br>
That — got through!<br>
It's early — yet — for "Spring"!<br>
There's that long town of White — to cross —<br>
Before the Blackbirds sing!<br>
It can't be "Dying"!<br>
It's too Rouge —<br>
The Dead shall go in White —<br>
So Sunset shuts my question down<br>
With Cuffs of Chrysolite!</p>
