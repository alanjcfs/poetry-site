<p>The Test of Love — is Death —<br>
Our Lord — "so loved" — it saith —<br>
What Largest Lover — hath<br>
Another — doth —<br><br>
If smaller Patience — be —<br>
Through less Infinity —<br>
If Bravo, sometimes swerve —<br>
Through fainter Nerve —<br><br>
Accept its Most —<br>
And overlook — the Dust —<br>
Last — Least —<br>
The Cross' — Request —</p>
