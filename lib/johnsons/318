<p>I'll tell you how the Sun rose —<br>
A Ribbon at a time —<br>
The Steeples swam in Amethyst —<br>
The news, like Squirrels, ran —<br>
The Hills untied their Bonnets —<br>
The Bobolinks — begun —<br>
Then I said softly to myself —<br>
"That must have been the Sun"!<br>
But how he set — I know not —<br>
There seemed a purple stile<br>
That little Yellow boys and girls<br>
Were climbing all the while —<br>
Till when they reached the other side,<br>
A Dominie in Gray —<br>
Put gently up the evening Bars —<br>
And led the flock away —</p>
