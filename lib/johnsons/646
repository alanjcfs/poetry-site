<p>I think to Live — may be a Bliss<br>
To those who dare to try —<br>
Beyond my limit to conceive —<br>
My lip — to testify —<br><br>
I think the Heart I former wore<br>
Could widen — till to me<br>
The Other, like the little Bank<br>
Appear — unto the Sea —<br><br>
I think the Days — could every one<br>
In Ordination stand —<br>
And Majesty — be easier —<br>
Than an inferior kind —<br><br>
No numb alarm — lest Difference come —<br>
No Goblin — on the Bloom —<br>
No start in Apprehension's Ear,<br>
No Bankruptcy — no Doom —<br><br>
But Certainties of Sun —<br>
Midsummer — in the Mind —<br>
A steadfast South — upon the Soul —<br>
Her Polar time — behind —<br><br>
The Vision — pondered long —<br>
So plausible becomes<br>
That I esteem the fiction — real —<br>
The Real — fictitious seems —<br><br>
How bountiful the Dream —<br>
What Plenty — it would be —<br>
Had all my Life but been Mistake<br>
Just rectified — in Thee</p>
