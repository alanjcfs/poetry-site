<p>It was a quiet way —<br>
He asked if I was his —<br>
I made no answer of the Tongue<br>
But answer of the Eyes —<br>
And then He bore me on<br>
Before this mortal noise<br>
With swiftness, as of Chariots<br>
And distance, as of Wheels.<br>
This World did drop away<br>
As Acres from the feet<br>
Of one that leaneth from Balloon<br>
Upon an Ether street.<br>
The Gulf behind was not,<br>
The Continents were new —<br>
Eternity it was before<br>
Eternity was due.<br>
No Seasons were to us —<br>
It was not Night nor Morn —<br>
But Sunrise stopped upon the place<br>
And fastened it in Dawn.</p>
