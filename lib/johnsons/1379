<p>His Mansion in the Pool<br>
The Frog forsakes —<br>
He rises on a Log<br>
And statements makes —<br>
His Auditors two Worlds<br>
Deducting me —<br>
The Orator of April<br>
Is hoarse Today —<br>
His Mittens at his Feet<br>
No Hand hath he —<br>
His eloquence a Bubble<br>
As Fame should be —<br>
Applaud him to discover<br>
To your chagrin<br>
Demosthenes has vanished<br>
In Waters Green —</p>
