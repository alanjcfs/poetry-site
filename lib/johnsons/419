<p>We grow accustomed to the Dark —<br>
When light is put away —<br>
As when the Neighbor holds the Lamp<br>
To witness her Goodbye —<br><br>
A Moment — We uncertain step<br>
For newness of the night —<br>
Then — fit our Vision to the Dark —<br>
And meet the Road — erect —<br><br>
And so of larger — Darkness —<br>
Those Evenings of the Brain —<br>
When not a Moon disclose a sign —<br>
Or Star — come out — within —<br><br>
The Bravest — grope a little —<br>
And sometimes hit a Tree<br>
Directly in the Forehead —<br>
But as they learn to see —<br><br>
Either the Darkness alters —<br>
Or something in the sight<br>
Adjusts itself to Midnight —<br>
And Life steps almost straight.</p>
