<p>The Frost of Death was on the Pane —<br>
"Secure your Flower" said he.<br>
Like Sailors fighting with a Leak<br>
We fought Mortality.<br><br>
Our passive Flower we held to Sea —<br>
To Mountain — To the Sun —<br>
Yet even on his Scarlet shelf<br>
To crawl the Frost begun —<br><br>
We pried him back<br>
Ourselves we wedged<br>
Himself and her between,<br>
Yet easy as the narrow Snake<br>
He forked his way along<br><br>
Till all her helpless beauty bent<br>
And then our wrath begun —<br>
We hunted him to his Ravine<br>
We chased him to his Den —<br><br>
We hated Death and hated Life<br>
And nowhere was to go —<br>
Than Sea and continent there is<br>
A larger — it is Woe —</p>
