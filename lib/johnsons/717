<p>The Beggar Lad — dies early —<br>
It's Somewhat in the Cold —<br>
And Somewhat in the Trudging feet —<br>
And haply, in the World —<br><br>
The Cruel — smiling — bowing World —<br>
That took its Cambric Way —<br>
Nor heard the timid cry for "Bread" —<br>
"Sweet Lady — Charity" —<br><br>
Among Redeemed Children<br>
If Trudging feet may stand<br>
The Barefoot time forgotten — so —<br>
The Sleet — the bitter Wind —<br><br>
The Childish Hands that teased for Pence<br>
Lifted adoring — them —<br>
To Him whom never Ragged — Coat<br>
Did supplicate in vain —</p>
