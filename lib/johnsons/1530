<p>A Pang is more conspicuous in Spring<br>
In contrast with the things that sing<br>
Not Birds entirely — but Minds —<br>
Minute Effulgencies and Winds —<br>
When what they sung for is undone<br>
Who cares about a Blue Bird's Tune —<br>
Why, Resurrection had to wait<br>
Till they had moved a Stone —</p>
