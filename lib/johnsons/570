<p>I could die — to know —<br>
'Tis a trifling knowledge —<br>
News-Boys salute the Door —<br>
Carts — joggle by —<br>
Morning's bold face — stares in the window —<br>
Were but mine — the Charter of the least Fly —<br><br>
Houses hunch the House<br>
With their Brick Shoulders —<br>
Coals — from a Rolling Load — rattle — how — near —<br>
To the very Square — His foot is passing —<br>
Possibly, this moment —<br>
While I — dream — Here —</p>
