<p>I cannot see my soul but know 'tis there<br>
Nor ever saw his house nor furniture,<br>
Who has invited me with him to dwell;<br>
But a confiding guest consult as well,<br>
What raiment honor him the most,<br>
That I be adequately dressed,<br>
For he insures to none<br>
Lest men specified adorn<br>
Procuring him perpetual drest<br>
By dating it a sudden feast.</p>
