<p>You're right — "the way is narrow" —<br>
And "difficult the Gate" —<br>
And "few there be" — Correct again —<br>
That "enter in — thereat" —<br><br>
'Tis Costly — So are purples!<br>
'Tis just the price of Breath —<br>
With but the "Discount" of the Grave —<br>
Termed by the Brokers — "Death"!<br><br>
And after that — there's Heaven —<br>
The Good Man's — "Dividend" —<br>
And Bad Men — "go to Jail" —<br>
I guess —</p>
