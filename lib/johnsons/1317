<p>Abraham to kill him —<br>
Was distinctly told —<br>
Isaac was an Urchin —<br>
Abraham was old —<br><br>
Not a hesitation —<br>
Abraham complied —<br>
Flattered by Obeisance<br>
Tyranny demurred —<br><br>
Isaac — to his children<br>
Lived to tell the tale —<br>
Moral — with a Mastiff<br>
Manners may prevail.</p>
