<p>The Moon is distant from the Sea —<br>
And yet, with Amber Hands —<br>
She leads Him — docile as a Boy —<br>
Along appointed Sands —<br><br>
He never misses a Degree —<br>
Obedient to Her Eye<br>
He comes just so far — toward the Town —<br>
Just so far — goes away —<br><br>
Oh, Signor, Thine, the Amber Hand —<br>
And mine — the distant Sea —<br>
Obedient to the least command<br>
Thine eye impose on me —</p>
