<br><p><b>Version 1:<br></b> A narrow fellow in the grass<br>
Occasionally rides;<br>
You may have met him—did you not<br>
His notice instant is,<br>
The grass divides as with a comb,<br>
A spotted shaft is seen,<br>
And then it closes at your feet,<br>
And opens further on.<br><br>
He likes a boggy acre<br>
A floor too cool for corn,<br>
Yet when a boy and barefoot,<br>
I more than once at noon<br>
Have passed, I thought, a whip lash,<br>
Unbraiding in the sun,<br>
When stooping to secure it,<br>
It wrinkled and was gone.<br><br>
Several of nature's people<br>
I know, and they know me;<br>
I feel for them a transport<br>
Of cordiality.<br>
Yet never met this fellow,<br>
Attended or alone,<br>
Without a tighter breathing,<br>
And zero at the bone.<br><br></p>
