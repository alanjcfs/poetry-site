<p>The Things that never can come back, are several —<br>
Childhood — some forms of Hope — the Dead —<br>
Though Joys — like Men — may sometimes make a Journey —<br>
And still abide —<br>
We do not mourn for Traveler, or Sailor,<br>
Their Routes are fair —<br>
But think enlarged of all that they will tell us<br>
Returning here —<br>
"Here!" There are typic "Heres" —<br>
Foretold Locations —<br>
The Spirit does not stand —<br>
Himself — at whatsoever Fathom<br>
His Native Land —</p>
