<p>The Robin is a Gabriel<br>
In humble circumstances —<br>
His Dress denotes him socially,<br>
Of Transport's Working Classes —<br>
He has the punctuality<br>
Of the New England Farmer —<br>
The same oblique integrity,<br>
A Vista vastly warmer —<br><br>
A small but sturdy Residence<br>
A self denying Household,<br>
The Guests of Perspicacity<br>
Are all that cross his Threshold —<br>
As covert as a Fugitive,<br>
Cajoling Consternation<br>
By Ditties to the Enemy<br>
And Sylvan Punctuation —</p>
