<p>Must be a Woe —<br>
A loss or so —<br>
To bend the eye<br>
Best Beauty's way —<br><br>
But — once aslant<br>
It notes Delight<br>
As difficult<br>
As Stalactite<br><br>
A Common Bliss<br>
Were had for less —<br>
The price — is<br>
Even as the Grace —<br><br>
Our lord — thought no<br>
Extravagance<br>
To pay — a Cross —</p>
