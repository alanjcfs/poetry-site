<p>Nature — the Gentlest Mother is,<br>
Impatient of no Child —<br>
The feeblest — or the waywardest —<br>
Her Admonition mild —<br><br>
In Forest — and the Hill —<br>
By Traveller — be heard —<br>
Restraining Rampant Squirrel —<br>
Or too impetuous Bird —<br><br>
How fair Her Conversation —<br>
A Summer Afternoon —<br>
Her Household — Her Assembly —<br>
And when the Sun go down —<br><br>
Her Voice among the Aisles<br>
Incite the timid prayer<br>
Of the minutest Cricket —<br>
The most unworthy Flower —<br><br>
When all the Children sleep —<br>
She turns as long away<br>
As will suffice to light Her lamps —<br>
Then bending from the Sky —<br><br>
With infinite Affection —<br>
And infiniter Care —<br>
Her Golden finger on Her lip —<br>
Wills Silence — Everywhere —</p>
