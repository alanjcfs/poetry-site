<p>As Summer into Autumn slips<br>
And yet we sooner say<br>
"The Summer" than "the Autumn," lest<br>
We turn the sun away,<br><br>
And almost count it an Affront<br>
The presence to concede<br>
Of one however lovely, not<br>
The one that we have loved â€”<br><br>
So we evade the charge of Years<br>
On one attempting shy<br>
The Circumvention of the Shaft<br>
Of Life's Declivity.</p>
