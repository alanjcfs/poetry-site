<p>Fairer through Fading — as the Day<br>
Into the Darkness dips away —<br>
Half Her Complexion of the Sun —<br>
Hindering — Haunting — Perishing —<br><br>
Rallies Her Glow, like a dying Friend —<br>
Teasing with glittering Amend —<br>
Only to aggravate the Dark<br>
Through an expiring — perfect — look —</p>
