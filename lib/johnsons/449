Adjusted in the tomb,<br>
When one who died for truth was lain<br>
In an adjoining room.<br><br>
He questioned softly why I failed ?<br>
"For beauty," I replied.<br>
"And I for truth, — the two are one ;<br>
We brethren are," he said.<br><br>
And so, as kinsmen met a night,<br>
We talked between the rooms,<br>
Until the moss had reached our lips,<br>
And covered up our names.</p>
