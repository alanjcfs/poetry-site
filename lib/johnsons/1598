<p>Who is it seeks my Pillow Nights —<br>
With plain inspecting face —<br>
"Did you" or "Did you not," to ask —<br>
'Tis "Conscience" — Childhood's Nurse —<br><br>
With Martial Hand she strokes the Hair<br>
Upon my wincing Head —<br>
"All" Rogues "shall have their part in" what —<br>
The Phosphorous of God —</p>
