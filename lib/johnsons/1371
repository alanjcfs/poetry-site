<p>How fits his Umber Coat<br>
The Tailor of the Nut?<br>
Combined without a seam<br>
Like Raiment of a Dream —<br><br>
Who spun the Auburn Cloth?<br>
Computed how the girth?<br>
The Chestnut aged grows<br>
In those primeval Clothes —<br><br>
We know that we are wise —<br>
Accomplished in Surprise —<br>
Yet by this Countryman —<br>
This nature — how undone!</p>
