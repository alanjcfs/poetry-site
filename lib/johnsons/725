<p>Where Thou art — that — is Home —<br>
Cashmere — or Calvary — the same —<br>
Degree — or Shame —<br>
I scarce esteem Location's Name —<br>
So I may Come —<br><br>
What Thou dost — is Delight —<br>
Bondage as Play — be sweet —<br>
Imprisonment — Content —<br>
And Sentence — Sacrament —<br>
Just We two — meet —<br><br>
Where Thou art not — is Woe —<br>
Tho' Bands of Spices — row —<br>
What Thou dost not — Despair —<br>
Tho' Gabriel — praise me — Sire —</p>
