<p>It's thoughts — and just One Heart —<br>
And Old Sunshine — about —<br>
Make frugal — Ones — Content —<br>
And two or three — for Company —<br>
Upon a Holiday —<br>
Crowded — as Sacrament —<br>
<br>
Books — when the Unit —<br>
Spare the Tenant — long eno' —<br>
A Picture — if it Care —<br>
Itself — a Gallery too rare —<br>
For needing more —<br>
<br>
Flowers — to keep the Eyes — from going awkward —<br>
When it snows —<br>
A Bird — if they — prefer —<br>
Though Winter fire — sing clear as Plover —<br>
To our — ear —<br>
<br>
A Landscape — not so great<br>
To suffocate the Eye —<br>
A Hill — perhaps —<br>
Perhaps — the profile of a Mill<br>
Turned by the Wind —<br>
Tho' such — are luxuries —<br>
<br>
It's thoughts — and just two Heart —<br>
And Heaven — about —<br>
At least — a Counterfeit —<br>
We would not have Correct —<br>
And Immortality — can be almost —<br>
Not quite — Content —</p>
