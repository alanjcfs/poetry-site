<p>Me from Myself — to banish —<br>
Had I Art —<br>
Impregnable my Fortress<br>
Unto All Heart —<br><br>
But since Myself — assault Me —<br>
How have I peace<br>
Except by subjugating<br>
Consciousness?<br><br>
And since We're mutual Monarch<br>
How this be<br>
Except by Abdication —<br>
Me — of Me?</p>
