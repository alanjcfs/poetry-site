<p>I've none to tell me to but Thee<br>
So when Thou failest, nobody.<br>
It was a little tie —<br>
It just held Two, nor those it held<br>
Since Somewhere thy sweet Face has spilled<br>
Beyond my Boundary —<br><br>
If things were opposite — and Me<br>
And Me it were — that ebbed from Thee<br>
On some unanswering Shore —<br>
Would'st Thou seek so — just say<br>
That I the Answer may pursue<br>
Unto the lips it eddied through —<br>
So — overtaking Thee —</p>
