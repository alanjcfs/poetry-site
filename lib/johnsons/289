<p>I know some lonely Houses off the Road<br>
A Robber'd like the look of —<br>
Wooden barred,<br>
And Windows hanging low,<br>
Inviting to —<br>
A Portico,<br>
Where two could creep —<br>
One — hand the Tools —<br>
The other peep —<br>
To make sure All's Asleep —<br>
Old fashioned eyes —<br>
Not easy to surprise!<br><br>
How orderly the Kitchen'd look, by night,<br>
With just a Clock —<br>
But they could gag the Tick —<br>
And Mice won't bark —<br>
And so the Walls — don't tell —<br>
None — will —<br><br>
A pair of Spectacles ajar just stir —<br>
An Almanac's aware —<br>
Was it the Mat — winked,<br>
Or a Nervous Star?<br>
The Moon — slides down the stair,<br>
To see who's there!<br><br>
There's plunder — where —<br>
Tankard, or Spoon —<br>
Earring — or Stone —<br>
A Watch — Some Ancient Brooch<br>
To match the Grandmama —<br>
Staid sleeping — there —<br><br>
Day — rattles — too<br>
Stealth's — slow —<br>
The Sun has got as far<br>
As the third Sycamore —<br>
Screams Chanticleer<br>
"Who's there"?<br><br>
And Echoes — Trains away,<br>
Sneer — "Where"!<br>
While the old Couple, just astir,<br>
Fancy the Sunrise — left the door ajar!</p>
