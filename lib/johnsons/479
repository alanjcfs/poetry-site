<p>She dealt her pretty words like Blades —<br>
How glittering they shone —<br>
And every One unbared a Nerve<br>
Or wantoned with a Bone —<br><br>
She never deemed — she hurt —<br>
That — is not Steel's Affair —<br>
A vulgar grimace in the Flesh —<br>
How ill the Creatures bear —<br><br>
To Ache is human — not polite —<br>
The Film upon the eye<br>
Mortality's old Custom —<br>
Just locking up — to Die.</p>
