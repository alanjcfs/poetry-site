<p>I could not prove the Years had feet —<br>
Yet confident they run<br>
Am I, from symptoms that are past<br>
And Series that are done —<br><br>
I find my feet have further Goals —<br>
I smile upon the Aims<br>
That felt so ample — Yesterday —<br>
Today's — have vaster claims —<br><br>
I do not doubt the self I was<br>
Was competent to me —<br>
But something awkward in the fit —<br>
Proves that — outgrown — I see —</p>
