<p>I never felt at Home — Below —-<br>
And in the Handsome Skies<br>
I shall not feel at Home — I know —<br>
I don't like Paradise —<br>
<br>
Because it's Sunday — all the time —<br>
And Recess — never comes —<br>
And Eden'll be so lonesome<br>
Bright Wednesday Afternoons —<br>
<br>
If God could make a visit —<br>
Or ever took a Nap —<br>
So not to see us — but they say<br>
Himself — a Telescope<br>
<br>
Perennial beholds us —<br>
Myself would run away<br>
From Him — and Holy Ghost — and All —<br>
But there's the "Judgement Day"!</p>
