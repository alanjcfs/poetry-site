<p>The Trees like Tassels — hit — and swung —<br>
There seemed to rise a Tune<br>
From Miniature Creatures<br>
Accompanying the Sun —<br><br>
Far Psalteries of Summer —<br>
Enamoring the Ear<br>
They never yet did satisfy —<br>
Remotest — when most fair<br><br>
The Sun shone whole at intervals —<br>
Then Half — then utter hid —<br>
As if Himself were optional<br>
And had Estates of Cloud<br><br>
Sufficient to enfold Him<br>
Eternally from view —<br>
Except it were a whim of His<br>
To let the Orchards grow —<br><br>
A Bird sat careless on the fence —<br>
One gossipped in the Lane<br>
On silver matters charmed a Snake<br>
Just winding round a Stone —<br><br>
Bright Flowers slit a Calyx<br>
And soared upon a Stem<br>
Like Hindered Flags — Sweet hoisted —<br>
With Spices — in the Hem —<br><br>
'Twas more — I cannot mention —<br>
How mean — to those that see —<br>
Vandyke's Delineation<br>
Of Nature's — Summer Day!</p>
