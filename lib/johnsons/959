<p>A loss of something ever felt I —<br>
The first that I could recollect<br>
Bereft I was — of what I knew not<br>
Too young that any should suspect<br><br>
A Mourner walked among the children<br>
I notwithstanding went about<br>
As one bemoaning a Dominion<br>
Itself the only Prince cast out —<br><br>
Elder, Today, a session wiser<br>
And fainter, too, as Wiseness is —<br>
I find myself still softly searching<br>
For my Delinquent Palaces —<br><br>
And a Suspicion, like a Finger<br>
Touches my Forehead now and then<br>
That I am looking oppositely<br>
For the site of the Kingdom of Heaven —</p>
