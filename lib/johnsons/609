<p>I Years had been from Home<br>
And now before the Door<br>
I dared not enter, lest a Face<br>
I never saw before<br><br>
Stare solid into mine<br>
And ask my Business there —<br>
"My Business but a Life I left<br>
Was such remaining there?"<br><br>
I leaned upon the Awe —<br>
I lingered with Before —<br>
The Second like an Ocean rolled<br>
And broke against my ear —<br><br>
I laughed a crumbling Laugh<br>
That I could fear a Door<br>
Who Consternation compassed<br>
And never winced before.<br><br>
I fitted to the Latch<br>
My Hand, with trembling care<br>
Lest back the awful Door should spring<br>
And leave me in the Floor —<br><br>
Then moved my Fingers off<br>
As cautiously as Glass<br>
And held my ears, and like a Thief<br>
Fled gasping from the House —</p>
