<p>The Bird did prance — the Bee did play —<br>
The Sun ran miles away<br>
So blind with joy he could not choose<br>
Between his Holiday<br><br>
The morn was up — the meadows out<br>
The Fences all but ran,<br>
Republic of Delight, I thought<br>
Where each is Citizen —<br><br>
From Heavy laden Lands to thee<br>
Were seas to cross to come<br>
A Caspian were crowded —<br>
Too near thou art for Fame —</p>
