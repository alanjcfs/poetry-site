<p>Taken from men — this morning —<br>
Carried by men today —<br>
Met by the Gods with banners —<br>
Who marshalled her away —<br><br>
One little maid — from playmates —<br>
One little mind from school —<br>
There must be guests in Eden —<br>
All the rooms are full —<br><br>
Far — as the East from Even —<br>
Dim — as the border star —<br>
Courtiers quaint, in Kingdoms<br>
Our departed are.</p>
