<p>Remorse is memory awake,<br>
Her companies astir,---<br>
A presence of departed acts<br>
At window and at door.<br><br>
It's past set down before the soul,<br>
And lighted with a match,<br>
Perusal to facilitate<br>
Of its condensed despatch.<br><br>
Remorse is cureless,---the disease<br>
Not even God can heal;<br>
For 't is his institution,---<br>
The complement of hell.</p>
