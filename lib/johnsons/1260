<p>Because that you are going<br>
And never coming back<br>
And I, however absolute,<br>
May overlook your Track —<br>
<br>
Because that Death is final,<br>
However first it be,<br>
This instant be suspended<br>
Above Mortality —<br>
<br>
Significance that each has lived<br>
The other to detect<br>
Discovery not God himself<br>
Could now annihilate<br>
<br>
Eternity, Presumption<br>
The instant I perceive<br>
That you, who were Existence<br>
Yourself forgot to live —<br>
<br>
The "Life that is" will then have been<br>
A thing I never knew —<br>
As Paradise fictitious<br>
Until the Realm of you —<br>
<br>
The "Life that is to be," to me,<br>
A Residence too plain<br>
Unless in my Redeemer's Face<br>
I recognize your own —<br>
<br>
Of Immortality who doubts<br>
He may exchange with me<br>
Curtailed by your obscuring Face<br>
Of everything but He —<br>
<br>
Of Heaven and Hell I also yield<br>
The Right to reprehend<br>
To whoso would commute this Face<br>
For his less priceless Friend.<br>
<br>
If "God is Love" as he admits<br>
We think that me must be<br>
Because he is a "jealous God"<br>
He tells us certainly<br>
<br>
If "All is possible with" him<br>
As he besides concedes<br>
He will refund us finally<br>
Our confiscated Gods —</p>
