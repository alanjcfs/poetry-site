<p>I often passed the village<br>
When going home from school —<br>
And wondered what they did there —<br>
And why it was so still —<br><br>
I did not know the year then —<br>
In which my call would come —<br>
Earlier, by the Dial,<br>
Than the rest have gone.<br><br>
It's stiller than the sundown.<br>
It's cooler than the dawn —<br>
The Daisies dare to come here —<br>
And birds can flutter down —<br><br>
So when you are tired —<br>
Or perplexed — or cold —<br>
Trust the loving promise<br>
Underneath the mould,<br>
Cry "it's I," "take Dollie,"<br>
And I will enfold!</p>
