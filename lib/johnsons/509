<p>If anybody's friend be dead<br>
It's sharpest of the theme<br>
The thinking how they walked alive —<br>
At such and such a time —<br><br>
Their costume, of a Sunday,<br>
Some manner of the Hair —<br>
A prank nobody knew but them<br>
Lost, in the Sepulchre —<br><br>
How warm, they were, on such a day,<br>
You almost feel the date —<br>
So short way off it seems —<br>
And now — they're Centuries from that —<br><br>
How pleased they were, at what you said —<br>
You try to touch the smile<br>
And dip your fingers in the frost —<br>
When was it — Can you tell —<br><br>
You asked the Company to tea —<br>
Acquaintance — just a few —<br>
And chatted close with this Grand Thing<br>
That don't remember you —<br><br>
Past Bows, and Invitations —<br>
Past Interview, and Vow —<br>
Past what Ourself can estimate —<br>
That — makes the Quick of Woe!</p>
