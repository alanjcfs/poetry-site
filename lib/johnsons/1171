<p>On the World you colored<br>
Morning painted rose —<br>
Idle his Vermillion<br>
Aimlessly crept the Glows<br>
Over Realms of Orchards<br>
I the Day before<br>
Conquered with the Robin —<br>
Misery, how fair<br>
Till your wrinkled Finger<br>
Shored the sun away<br>
Midnight's awful Pattern<br>
In the Goods of Day —</p>
