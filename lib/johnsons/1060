<p>Air has no Residence, no Neighbor,<br>
No Ear, no Door,<br>
No Apprehension of Another<br>
Oh, Happy Air!<br><br>
Ethereal Guest at e'en an Outcast's Pillow —<br>
Essential Host, in Life's faint, wailing Inn,<br>
Later than Light thy Consciousness accost me<br>
Till it depart, persuading Mine —</p>
