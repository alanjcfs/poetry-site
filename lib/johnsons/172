If I should fail, what poverty !<br>
And yet, as poor as I<br>
Have ventured upon a throw ;<br>
Have gained!  Yes !  Hesitated so<br>
This side the victory !<br><br>
Life is but life, and death but death !<br>
Bliss is but bliss and breath but breath !<br>
And if, indeed, I fail,<br>
At least to know the worst is sweet.<br>
Defeat means nothing but defeat,<br>
No drearier can prevail !<br><br>
And if I gain, — oh, gun at sea,<br>
Oh, bells that in the steeples be,<br>
At first repeat it slow !<br>
For heaven is a different thing<br>
Conjectured, and waked sudden in,<br>
And might o'erwhelm me so !</p>
