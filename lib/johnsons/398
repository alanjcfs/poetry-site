<p>I had not minded — Walls —<br>
Were Universe — one Rock —<br>
And far I heard his silver Call<br>
The other side the Block —<br>
<br>
I'd tunnel — till my Groove<br>
Pushed sudden thro' to his —<br>
Then my face take her Recompense —<br>
The looking in his Eyes —<br>
<br>
But 'tis a single Hair —<br>
A filament — a law —<br>
A Cobweb — wove in Adamant —<br>
A Battlement — of Straw —<br>
<br>
A limit like the Veil<br>
Unto the Lady's face —<br>
But every Mesh — a Citadel —<br>
And Dragons — in the Crease —</p>
