<p>Musicians wrestle everywhere —<br>
All day — among the crowded air<br>
I hear the silver strife —<br>
And — waking — long before the morn —<br>
Such transport breaks upon the town<br>
I think it that "New Life"!<br>
<br>
If is not Bird — it has no nest —<br>
Nor "Band" — in brass and scarlet — drest —<br>
Nor Tamborin — nor Man —<br>
It is not Hymn from pulpit read —<br>
The "Morning Stars" the Treble led<br>
On Time's first Afternoon!<br>
<br>
Some — say — it is "the Spheres" — at play!<br>
Some say that bright Majority<br>
Of vanished Dames — and Men!<br>
Some — think it service in the place<br>
Where we — with late — celestial face —<br>
Please God — shall Ascertain!</p>
