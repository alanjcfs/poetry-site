<p>I prayed, at first, a little Girl,<br>
Because they told me to —<br>
But stopped, when qualified to guess<br>
How prayer would feel — to me —<br><br>
If I believed God looked around,<br>
Each time my Childish eye<br>
Fixed full, and steady, on his own<br>
In Childish honesty —<br><br>
And told him what I'd like, today,<br>
And parts of his far plan<br>
That baffled me —<br>
The mingled side<br>
Of his Divinity —<br><br>
And often since, in Danger,<br>
I count the force 'twould be<br>
To have a God so strong as that<br>
To hold my life for me<br><br>
Till I could take the Balance<br>
That tips so frequent, now,<br>
It takes me all the while to poise —<br>
And then — it doesn't stay —</p>
