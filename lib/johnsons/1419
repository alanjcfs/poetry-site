<p>It was a quiet seeming Day —<br>
There was no harm in earth or sky —<br>
Till with the closing sun<br>
There strayed an accidental Red<br>
A Strolling Hue, one would have said<br>
To westward of the Town —<br><br>
But when the Earth began to jar<br>
And Houses vanished with a roar<br>
And Human Nature hid<br>
We comprehended by the Awe<br>
As those that Dissolution saw<br>
The Poppy in the Cloud</p>
