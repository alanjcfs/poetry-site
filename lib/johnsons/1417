<p>How Human Nature dotes<br>
On what it can't detect.<br>
The moment that a Plot is plumbed<br>
Prospective is extinct —<br><br>
Prospective is the friend<br>
Reserved for us to know<br>
When Constancy is clarified<br>
Of Curiosity —<br><br>
Of subjects that resist<br>
Redoubtablest is this<br>
Where go we —<br>
Go we anywhere<br>
Creation after this?</p>
