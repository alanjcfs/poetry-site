<p>'Tis true — They shut me in the Cold —<br>
But then — Themselves were warm<br>
And could not know the feeling 'twas —<br>
Forget it — Lord — of Them —<br><br>
Let not my Witness hinder Them<br>
In Heavenly esteem —<br>
No Paradise could be — Conferred<br>
Through Their beloved Blame —<br><br>
The Harm They did — was short — And since<br>
Myself — who bore it — do —<br>
Forgive Them — Even as Myself —<br>
Or else — forgive not me —</p>
