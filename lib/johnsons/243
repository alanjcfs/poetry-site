<p>I've known a Heaven, like a Tent —<br>
To wrap its shining Yards —<br>
Pluck up its stakes, and disappear —<br>
Without the sound of Boards<br>
Or Rip of Nail — Or Carpenter —<br>
But just the miles of Stare —<br>
That signalize a Show's Retreat —<br>
In North America —<br>
<br>
No Trace — no Figment of the Thing<br>
That dazzled, Yesterday,<br>
No Ring — no Marvel —<br>
Men, and Feats —<br>
Dissolved as utterly —<br>
As Bird's far Navigation<br>
Discloses just a Hue —<br>
A plash of Oars, a Gaiety —<br>
Then swallowed up, of View.</p>
