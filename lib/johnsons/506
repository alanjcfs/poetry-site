<p>He touched me, so I live to know<br>
That such a day, permitted so,<br>
I groped upon his breast —<br>
It was a boundless place to me<br>
And silenced, as the awful sea<br>
Puts minor streams to rest.<br><br>
And now, I'm different from before,<br>
As if I breathed superior air —<br>
Or brushed a Royal Gown —<br>
My feet, too, that had wandered so —<br>
My Gypsy face — transfigured now —<br>
To tenderer Renown —<br><br>
Into this Port, if I might come,<br>
Rebecca, to Jerusalem,<br>
Would not so ravished turn —<br>
Nor Persian, baffled at her shrine<br>
Lift such a Crucifixial sign<br>
To her imperial Sun.</p>
