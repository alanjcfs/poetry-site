<p>The Love a Life can show Below<br>
Is but a filament, I know,<br>
Of that diviner thing<br>
That faints upon the face of Noon —<br>
And smites the Tinder in the Sun —<br>
And hinders Gabriel's Wing —<br><br>
'Tis this — in Music — hints and sways —<br>
And far abroad on Summer days —<br>
Distils uncertain pain —<br>
'Tis this enamors in the East —<br>
And tints the Transit in the West<br>
With harrowing Iodine —<br><br>
'Tis this — invites — appalls — endows —<br>
Flits — glimmers — proves — dissolves —<br>
Returns — suggests — convicts — enchants —<br>
Then — flings in Paradise —</p>
