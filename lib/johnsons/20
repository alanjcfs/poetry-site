<p>Distrustful of the Gentian —<br>
And just to turn away,<br>
The fluttering of her fringes<br>
Child my perfidy —<br>
Weary for my —————<br>
I will singing go —<br>
I shall not feel the sleet — then —<br>
I shall not fear the snow.<br>
<br>
Flees so the phantom meadow<br>
Before the breathless Bee —<br>
So bubble brooks in deserts<br>
On Ears that dying lie —<br>
Burn so the Evening Spires<br>
To Eyes that Closing go —<br>
Hangs so distant Heaven —<br>
To a hand below.</p>
