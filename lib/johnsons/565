<p>One Anguish — in a Crowd —<br>
A Minor thing — it sounds —<br>
And yet, unto the single Doe<br>
Attempted of the Hounds<br><br>
'Tis Terror as consummate<br>
As Legions of Alarm<br>
Did leap, full flanked, upon the Host —<br>
'Tis Units — make the Swarm —<br><br>
A Small Leech — on the Vitals —<br>
The sliver, in the Lung —<br>
The Bung out — of an Artery —<br>
Are scarce accounted — Harms —<br><br>
Yet might — by relation<br>
To that Repealless thing —<br>
A Being — impotent to end —<br>
When once it has begun —</p>
