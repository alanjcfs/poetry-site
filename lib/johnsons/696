<p>Their Height in Heaven comforts not —<br>
Their Glory — nought to me —<br>
'Twas best imperfect — as it was —<br>
I'm finite — I can't see —<br><br>
The House of Supposition —<br>
The Glimmering Frontier that<br>
Skirts the Acres of Perhaps —<br>
To Me — shows insecure —<br><br>
The Wealth I had — contented me —<br>
If 'twas a meaner size —<br>
Then I had counted it until<br>
It pleased my narrow Eyes —<br><br>
Better than larger values —<br>
That show however true —<br>
This timid life of Evidence<br>
Keeps pleading — "I don't know."</p>
