<p>An altered look about the hills —<br>
A Tyrian light the village fills —<br>
A wider sunrise in the morn —<br>
A deeper twilight on the lawn —<br>
A print of a vermillion foot —<br>
A purple finger on the slope —<br>
A flippant fly upon the pane —<br>
A spider at his trade again —<br>
An added strut in Chanticleer —<br>
A flower expected everywhere —<br>
An axe shrill singing in the woods —<br>
Fern odors on untravelled roads —<br>
All this and more I cannot tell —<br>
A furtive look you know as well —<br>
And Nicodemus' Mystery<br>
Receives its annual reply!</p>
