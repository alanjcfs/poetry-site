<p>Who occupies this House?<br>
A Stranger I must judge<br>
Since No one know His Circumstance —<br>
'Tis well the name and age<br><br>
Are writ upon the Door<br>
Or I should fear to pause<br>
Where not so much as Honest Dog<br>
Approach encourages.<br><br>
It seems a curious Town —<br>
Some Houses very old,<br>
Some — newly raised this Afternoon,<br>
Were I compelled to build<br><br>
It should not be among<br>
Inhabitants so still<br>
But where the Birds assemble<br>
And Boys were possible.<br><br>
Before Myself was born<br>
'Twas settled, so they say,<br>
A Territory for the Ghosts —<br>
And Squirrels, formerly.<br><br>
Until a Pioneer, as<br>
Settlers often do<br>
Liking the quiet of the Place<br>
Attracted more unto —<br><br>
And from a Settlement<br>
A Capital has grown<br>
Distinguished for the gravity<br>
Of every Citizen.<br><br>
The Owner of this House<br>
A Stranger He must be —<br>
Eternity's Acquaintances<br>
Are mostly so — to me.</p>
