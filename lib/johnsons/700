<p>You've seen Balloons set — Haven't You?<br>
So stately they ascend —<br>
It is as Swans — discarded You,<br>
For Duties Diamond —<br><br>
Their Liquid Feet go softly out<br>
Upon a Sea of Blonde —<br>
They spurn the Air, as t'were too mean<br>
For Creatures so renowned —<br><br>
Their Ribbons just beyond the eye —<br>
They struggle — some — for Breath —<br>
And yet the Crowd applaud, below —<br>
They would not encore — Death —<br><br>
The Gilded Creature strains — and spins —<br>
Trips frantic in a Tree —<br>
Tears open her imperial Veins —<br>
And tumbles in the Sea —<br><br>
The Crowd — retire with an Oath —<br>
The Dust in Streets — go down —<br>
And Clerks in Counting Rooms<br>
Observe — "'Twas only a Balloon" —</p>
