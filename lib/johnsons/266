<p>This — is the land — the Sunset washes —<br>
These — are the Banks of the Yellow Sea —<br>
Where it rose — or whither it rushes —<br>
These — are the Western Mystery!<br><br>
Night after Night<br>
Her purple traffic<br>
Strews the landing with Opal Bales —<br>
Merchantmen — poise upon Horizons —<br>
Dip — and vanish like Orioles!</p>
