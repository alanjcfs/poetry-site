<p>He fumbles at your Soul<br>
As Players at the Keys<br>
Before they drop full Music on —<br>
He stuns you by degrees —<br>
Prepares your brittle Nature<br>
For the Ethereal Blow<br>
By fainter Hammers — further heard —<br>
Then nearer — Then so slow<br>
Your Breath has time to straighten —<br>
Your Brain — to bubble Cool —<br>
Deals — One — imperial — Thunderbolt —<br>
That scalps your naked Soul —<br><br>
When Winds take Forests in the Paws —<br>
The Universe — is still —</p>
