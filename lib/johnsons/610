<p>You'll find — it when you try to die —<br>
The Easier to let go —<br>
For recollecting such as went —<br>
You could not spare — you know.<br><br>
And though their places somewhat filled —<br>
As did their Marble names<br>
With Moss — they never grew so full —<br>
You chose the newer names —<br><br>
And when this World — sets further back —<br>
As Dying — say it does —<br>
The former love — distincter grows —<br>
And supersedes the fresh —<br><br>
And Thought of them — so fair invites —<br>
It looks too tawdry Grace<br>
To stay behind — with just the Toys<br>
We bought — to ease their place —</p>
