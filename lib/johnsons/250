<p>I shall keep singing!<br>
Birds will pass me<br>
On their way to Yellower Climes —<br>
Each — with a Robin's expectation —<br>
I — with my Redbreast —<br>
And my Rhymes —<br><br>
Late — when I take my place in summer —<br>
But — I shall bring a fuller tune —<br>
Vespers — are sweeter than Matins — Signor —<br>
Morning — only the seed of Noon —</p>
