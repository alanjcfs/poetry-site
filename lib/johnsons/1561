<p>No Brigadier throughout the Year<br>
So civic as the Jay —<br>
A Neighbor and a Warrior too<br>
With shrill felicity<br>
Pursuing Winds that censure us<br>
A February Day,<br>
The Brother of the Universe<br>
Was never blown away —<br>
The Snow and he are intimate —<br>
I've often seem them play<br>
When Heaven looked upon us all<br>
With such severity<br>
I felt apology were due<br>
To an insulted sky<br>
Whose pompous frown was Nutriment<br>
To their Temerity —<br>
The Pillow of this daring Head<br>
Is pungent Evergreens —<br>
His Larder — terse and Militant —<br>
Unknown — refreshing things —<br>
His Character — a Tonic —<br>
His future — a Dispute —<br>
Unfair an Immortality<br>
That leaves this Neighbor out —</p>
