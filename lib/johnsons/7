<p>The feet of people walking home<br>
With gayer sandals go -<br>
The crocus - till she rises -<br>
The vassal of the snow -<br>
The lips at Hallelujah<br>
Long years of practise bore -<br>
Till bye and bye, these Bargemen<br>
Walked - singing - on the shore<br><br>
Pearls are the Diver's farthings<br>
Extorted form the sea -<br>
Pinions - the Seraph's wagon -<br>
Pedestrian once - as we -<br>
Night is the morning's canvas -<br>
Larceny - legacy -<br>
Death - but our rapt attention<br>
To immortality.<br><br>
My figures fail to tell me<br>
How far the village lies -<br>
Whose peasants are the angels -<br>
Whose cantons dot the skies -<br>
My Classics vail their faces -<br>
My faith that Dark adores -<br>
Which from it's solemn abbeys -<br>
Such resurrection pours!</p>
