<p>A something in a summer's Day<br>
As slow her flambeaux burn away<br>
Which solemnizes me.<br><br>
A something in a summer's noon —<br>
A depth — an Azure — a perfume —<br>
Transcending ecstasy.<br><br>
And still within a summer's night<br>
A something so transporting bright<br>
I clap my hands to see —<br><br>
Then veil my too inspecting face<br>
Lets such a subtle — shimmering grace<br>
Flutter too far for me —<br><br>
The wizard fingers never rest —<br>
The purple brook within the breast<br>
Still chafes its narrow bed —<br><br>
Still rears the East her amber Flag —<br>
Guides still the sun along the Crag<br>
His Caravan of Red —<br><br>
So looking on — the night — the morn<br>
Conclude the wonder gay —<br>
And I meet, coming thro' the dews<br>
Another summer's Day!</p>
