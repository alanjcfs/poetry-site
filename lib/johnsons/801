<p>I play at Riches — to appease<br>
The Clamoring for Gold —<br>
It kept me from a Thief, I think,<br>
For often, overbold<br><br>
With Want, and Opportunity —<br>
I could have done a Sin<br>
And been Myself that easy Thing<br>
An independent Man —<br><br>
But often as my lot displays<br>
Too hungry to be borne<br>
I deem Myself what I would be —<br>
And novel Comforting<br><br>
My Poverty and I derive —<br>
We question if the Man —<br>
Who own — Esteem the Opulence —<br>
As We — Who never Can —<br><br>
Should ever these exploring Hands<br>
Chance Sovereign on a Mine —<br>
Or in the long — uneven term<br>
To win, become their turn —<br><br>
How fitter they will be — for Want —<br>
Enlightening so well —<br>
I know not which, Desire, or Grant —<br>
Be wholly beautiful —</p>
