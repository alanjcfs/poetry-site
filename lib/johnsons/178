<p>I cautious, scanned my little life —<br>
I winnowed what would fade<br>
From what would last till Heads like mine<br>
Should be a-dreaming laid.<br>
<br>
I put the latter in a Barn —<br>
The former, blew away.<br>
I went one winter morning<br>
And lo - my priceless Hay<br>
<br>
Was not upon the "Scaffold" —<br>
Was not upon the "Beam" —<br>
And from a thriving Farmer —<br>
A Cynic, I became.<br>
<br>
Whether a Thief did it —<br>
Whether it was the wind —<br>
Whether Deity's guiltless —<br>
My business is, to find!<br>
<br>
So I begin to ransack!<br>
How is it Hearts, with Thee?<br>
Art thou within the little Barn<br>
Love provided Thee?</p>
