<p>To learn the Transport by the Pain<br>
As Blind Men learn the sun!<br>
To die of thirst — suspecting<br>
That Brooks in Meadows run!<br><br>
To stay the homesick — homesick feet<br>
Upon a foreign shore —<br>
Haunted by native lands, the while —<br>
And blue — beloved air!<br><br>
This is the Sovereign Anguish!<br>
This — the signal woe!<br>
These are the patient "Laureates"<br>
Whose voices — trained — below —<br><br>
Ascend in ceaseless Carol —<br>
Inaudible, indeed,<br>
To us — the duller scholars<br>
Of the Mysterious Bard!</p>
