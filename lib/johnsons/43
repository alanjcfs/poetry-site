<p>Could live — did live —<br>
Could die — did die —<br>
Could smile upon the whole<br>
Through faith in one he met not,<br>
To introduce his soul.<br>
<br>
Could go from scene familiar<br>
To an untraversed spot —<br>
Could contemplate the journey<br>
With unpuzzled heart —<br>
<br>
Such trust had one among us,<br>
Among us not today —<br>
We who saw the launching<br>
Never sailed the Bay!</p>
