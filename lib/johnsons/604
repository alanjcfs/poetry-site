<p>Unto my Books — so good to turn —<br>
Far ends of tired Days —<br>
It half endears the Abstinence —<br>
And Pain — is missed — in Praise —<br><br>
As Flavors — cheer Retarded Guests<br>
With Banquettings to be —<br>
So Spices — stimulate the time<br>
Till my small Library —<br><br>
It may be Wilderness — without —<br>
Far feet of failing Men —<br>
But Holiday — excludes the night —<br>
And it is Bells — within —<br><br>
I thank these Kinsmen of the Shelf —<br>
Their Countenances Kid<br>
Enamor — in Prospective —<br>
And satisfy — obtained —</p>
