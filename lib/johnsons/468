<p>The Manner of its Death<br>
When Certain it must die —<br>
'Tis deemed a privilege to choose —<br>
'Twas Major Andre's Way —<br><br>
When Choice of Life — is past —<br>
There yet remains a Love<br>
Its little Fate to stipulate —<br><br>
How small in those who live —<br><br>
The Miracle to tease<br>
With Bable of the styles —<br>
How "they are Dying mostly — now" —<br>
And Customs at "St. James"!</p>
