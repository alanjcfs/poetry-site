<p>High from the earth I heard a bird,<br>
He trod upon the trees<br>
As he esteemed them trifles,<br>
And then he spied a breeze,<br>
And situated softly<br>
Upon a pile of wind<br>
Which in a perturbation<br>
Nature had left behind.<br>
A joyous going fellow<br>
I gathered from his talk<br>
Which both of benediction<br>
And badinage partook.<br>
Without apparent burden<br>
I subsequently learned<br>
He was the faithful father<br>
Of a dependent brood.<br>
And this untoward transport<br>
His remedy for care.<br>
A contrast to our respites.<br>
How different we are!</p>
