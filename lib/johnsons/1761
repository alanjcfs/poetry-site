<p>A train went through a burial gate,<br>
A bird broke forth and sang,<br>
And trilled, and quivered, and shook his throat<br>
Till all the churchyard rangÂ ;<br><br>
And then adjusted his little notes,<br>
And bowed and sang again.<br>
Doubtless, he thought it meet of him<br>
To say good-by to men.</p>
