<p>Quite empty, quite at rest,<br>
The Robin locks her Nest, and tries her Wings.<br>
She does not know a Route<br>
But puts her Craft about<br>
For rumored Springs —<br>
She does not ask for Noon —<br>
She does not ask for Boon,<br>
Crumbless and homeless, of but one request —<br>
The Birds she lost —</p>
