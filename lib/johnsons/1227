<p>My Triumph lasted till the Drums<br>
Had left the Dead alone<br>
And then I dropped my Victory<br>
And chastened stole along<br>
To where the finished Faces<br>
Conclusion turned on me<br>
And then I hated Glory<br>
And wished myself were They.<br><br>
What is to be is best descried<br>
When it has also been —<br>
Could Prospect taste of Retrospect<br>
The tyrannies of Men<br>
Were Tenderer — diviner<br>
The Transitive toward.<br>
A Bayonet's contrition<br>
Is nothing to the Dead.</p>
