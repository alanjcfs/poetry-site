<p>Read — Sweet — how others — strove —<br>
Till we — are stouter —<br>
What they — renounced —<br>
Till we — are less afraid —<br>
How many times they — bore the faithful witness —<br>
Till we — are helped —<br>
As if a Kingdom — cared!<br><br>
Read then — of faith —<br>
That shone above the fagot —<br>
Clear strains of Hymn<br>
The River could not drown —<br>
Brave names of Men —<br>
And Celestial Women —<br>
Passed out — of Record<br>
Into — Renown!</p>
