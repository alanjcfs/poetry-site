<p>The most triumphant Bird I ever knew or met<br>
Embarked upon a twig today<br>
And till Dominion set<br>
I famish to behold so eminent a sight<br>
And sang for nothing scrutable<br>
But intimate Delight.<br>
Retired, and resumed his transitive Estate â€”<br>
To what delicious Accident<br>
Does finest Glory fit!</p>
