<p><big style="font-size: 130%; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Have</span></big> you got a brook in your little heart,<br>
Where bashful flowers blow,<br>
And blushing birds go down to drink,<br>
And shadows tremble so ?<br><br>
And nobody knows, so still it flows,<br>
That any brook is there ;<br>
And yet your little draught of life<br>
Is daily drunken there.<br><br>
Then look out for the little brook in March,<br>
When the rivers overflow,<br>
And the snows come hurrying from the hills,<br>
And the bridges often go.<br><br>
And later, in August it may be,<br>
When the meadows parching lie,<br>
Beware, lest this little brook of life<br>
Some burning noon go dry !</p>
