<p>She bore it till the simple veins<br>
Traced azure on her hand —<br>
Til pleading, round her quiet eyes<br>
The purple Crayons stand.<br><br>
Till Daffodils had come and gone<br>
I cannot tell the sum,<br>
And then she ceased to bear it —<br>
And with the Saints sat down.<br><br>
No more her patient figure<br>
At twilight soft to meet —<br>
No more her timid bonnet<br>
Upon the village street —<br><br>
But Crowns instead, and Courtiers —<br>
And in the midst so fair,<br>
Whose but her shy — immortal face<br>
Of whom we're whispering here?</p>
