<p>I rose — because He sank —<br>
I thought it would be opposite —<br>
But when his power dropped —<br>
My Soul grew straight.<br><br>
I cheered my fainting Prince —<br>
I sang firm — even — Chants —<br>
I helped his Film — with Hymn —<br><br>
And when the Dews drew off<br>
That held his Forehead stiff —<br>
I met him —<br>
Balm to Balm —<br><br>
I told him Best — must pass<br>
Through this low Arch of Flesh —<br>
No Casque so brave<br>
It spurn the Grave —<br><br>
I told him Worlds I knew<br>
Where Emperors grew —<br>
Who recollected us<br>
If we were true —<br><br>
And so with Thews of Hymn —<br>
And Sinew from within —<br>
And ways I knew not that I knew — till then —<br>
I lifted Him —</p>
