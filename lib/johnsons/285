<p>The Robin's my Criterion for Tune —<br>
Because I grow — where Robins do —<br>
But, were I Cuckoo born —<br>
I'd swear by him —<br>
The ode familiar — rules the Noon —<br>
The Buttercup's, my Whim for Bloom —<br>
Because, we're Orchard sprung —<br>
But, were I Britain born,<br>
I'd Daisies spurn —<br>
None but the Nut — October fit —<br>
Because, through dropping it,<br>
The Seasons flit — I'm taught —<br>
Without the Snow's Tableau<br>
Winter, were lie — to me —<br>
Because I see — New Englandly —<br>
The Queen, discerns like me —<br>
Provincially —</p>
