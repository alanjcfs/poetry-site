<p>If I could bribe them by a Rose<br>
I'd bring them every flower that grows<br>
From Amherst to Cashmere!<br>
I would not stop for night, or storm —<br>
Or frost, or death, or anyone —<br>
My business were so dear!<br><br>
If they would linger for a Bird<br>
My Tambourin were soonest heard<br>
Among the April Woods!<br>
Unwearied, all the summer long,<br>
Only to break in wilder song<br>
When Winter shook the boughs!<br><br>
What if they hear me!<br>
Who shall say<br>
That such an importunity<br>
May not at last avail?<br><br>
That, weary of this Beggar's face —<br>
They may not finally say, Yes —<br>
To drive her from the Hall?</p>
