<p>It would never be Common — more — I said —<br>
Difference — had begun —<br>
Many a bitterness — had been —<br>
But that old sort — was done —<br>
<br>
Or — if it sometime — showed — as 'twill —<br>
Upon the Downiest — Morn —<br>
Such bliss — had I — for all the years —<br>
'Twould give an Easier — pain —<br>
<br>
I'd so much joy — I told it — Red —<br>
Upon my simple Cheek —<br>
I felt it publish — in my Eye —<br>
'Twas needless — any speak —<br>
<br>
I walked — as wings — my body bore —<br>
The feet — I former used —<br>
Unnecessary — now to me —<br>
As boots — would be — to Birds —<br>
<br>
I put my pleasure all abroad —<br>
I dealth a word of Gold<br>
To every Creature — that I met —<br>
And Dowered — all the World —<br>
<br>
When — suddenly — my Riches shrank —<br>
A Goblin — drank my Dew —<br>
My Palaces — dropped tenantless —<br>
Myself — was beggared — too —<br>
<br>
I clutched at sounds —<br>
I groped at shapes —<br>
I touched the tops of Films —<br>
I felt the Wilderness roll back<br>
Along my Golden lines —<br>
<br>
The Sackcloth — hangs upon the nail —<br>
The Frock I used to wear —<br>
But where my moment of Brocade —<br>
My — drop — of India?</p>
