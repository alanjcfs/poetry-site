<p>Wonder — is not precisely Knowing<br>
And not precisely Knowing not —<br>
A beautiful but bleak condition<br>
He has not lived who has not felt —<br><br>
Suspense — is his maturer Sister —<br>
Whether Adult Delight is Pain<br>
Or of itself a new misgiving —<br>
This is the Gnat that mangles men —</p>
