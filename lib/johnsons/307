<p>The One who could repeat the Summer day —<br>
Were greater than itself — though He<br>
Minutest of Mankind should be —<br><br>
And He — could reproduce the Sun —<br>
At period of going down —<br>
The Lingering — and the Stain — I mean —<br><br>
When Orient have been outgrown —<br>
And Occident — become Unknown —<br>
His Name — remain —</p>
