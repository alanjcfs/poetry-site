<p>Ah, Teneriffe!<br>
Retreating Mountain!<br>
Purples of Ages — pause for you —<br>
Sunset — reviews her Sapphire Regiment —<br>
Day — drops you her Red Adieu!<br><br>
Still — Clad in your Mail of ices —<br>
Thigh of Granite — and thew — of Steel —<br>
Heedless — alike — of pomp — or parting<br><br>
Ah, Teneriffe!<br>
I'm kneeling — still —</p>
