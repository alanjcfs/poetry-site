<p>He put the Belt around my life<br>
I heard the Buckle snap —<br>
And turned away, imperial,<br>
My Lifetime folding up —<br>
Deliberate, as a Duke would do<br>
A Kingdom's Title Deed —<br>
Henceforth, a Dedicated sort —<br>
A Member of the Cloud.<br><br>
Yet not too far to come at call —<br>
And do the little Toils<br>
That make the Circuit of the Rest —<br>
And deal occasional smiles<br>
To lives that stoop to notice mine —<br>
And kindly ask it in —<br>
Whose invitation, know you not<br>
For Whom I must decline?</p>
