<p>It would have starved a Gnat —<br>
To live so small as I —<br>
And yet I was a living Child —<br>
With Food's necessity<br><br>
Upon me — like a Claw —<br>
I could no more remove<br>
Than I could coax a Leech away —<br>
Or make a Dragon — move —<br><br>
Not like the Gnat — had I —<br>
The privilege to fly<br>
And seek a Dinner for myself —<br>
How mightier He — than I —<br><br>
Nor like Himself — the Art<br>
Upon the Window Pane<br>
To gad my little Being out —<br>
And not begin — again —</p>
