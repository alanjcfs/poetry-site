<p>Let Us play Yesterday —<br>
I — the Girl at school —<br>
You — and Eternity — the<br>
Untold Tale —<br><br>
Easing my famine<br>
At my Lexicon —<br>
Logarithm — had I — for Drink —<br>
'Twas a dry Wine —<br><br>
Somewhat different — must be —<br>
Dreams tint the Sleep —<br>
Cunning Reds of Morning<br>
Make the Blind — leap —<br><br>
Still at the Egg-life —<br>
Chafing the Shell —<br>
When you troubled the Ellipse —<br>
And the Bird fell —<br><br>
Manacles be dim — they say —<br>
To the new Free —<br>
Liberty — Commoner —<br>
Never could — to me —<br><br>
'Twas my last gratitude<br>
When I slept — at night —<br>
'Twas the first Miracle<br>
Let in — with Light —<br><br>
Can the Lark resume the Shell —<br>
Easier — for the Sky —<br>
Wouldn't Bonds hurt more<br>
Than Yesterday?<br><br>
Wouldn't Dungeons sorer frate<br>
On the Man — free —<br>
Just long enough to taste —<br>
Then — doomed new —<br><br>
God of the Manacle<br>
As of the Free —<br>
Take not my Liberty<br>
Away from Me —</p>
