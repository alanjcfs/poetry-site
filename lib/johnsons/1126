<p>Shall I take thee, the Poet said<br>
To the propounded word?<br>
Be stationed with the Candidates<br>
Till I have finer tried —<br><br>
The Poet searched Philology<br>
And when about to ring<br>
For the suspended Candidate<br>
There came unsummoned in —<br><br>
That portion of the Vision<br>
The Word applied to fill<br>
Not unto nomination<br>
The Cherubim reveal —</p>
