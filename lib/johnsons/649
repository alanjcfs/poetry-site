<p>Her Sweet turn to leave the Homestead<br>
Came the Darker Way —<br>
Carriages — Be Sure — and Guests — too —<br>
But for Holiday<br><br>
'Tis more pitiful Endeavor<br>
Than did Loaded Sea<br>
O'er the Curls attempt to caper<br>
It had cast away —<br><br>
Never Bride had such Assembling —<br>
Never kinsmen kneeled<br>
To salute so fair a Forehead —<br>
Garland be indeed —<br><br>
Fitter Feet — of Her before us —<br>
Than whatever Brow<br>
Art of Snow — or Trick of Lily<br>
Possibly bestow<br><br>
Of Her Father — Whoso ask Her —<br>
He shall seek as high<br>
As the Palm — that serve the Desert —<br>
To obtain the Sky —<br><br>
Distance — be Her only Motion —<br>
If 'tis Nay — or Yes —<br>
Acquiescence — or Demurral —<br>
Whosoever guess —<br><br>
He — must pass the Crystal Angle<br>
That obscure Her face —<br>
He — must have achieved in person<br>
Equal Paradise —</p>
