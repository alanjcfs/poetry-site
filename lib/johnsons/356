<p>The Day that I was crowned<br>
Was like the other Days —<br>
Until the Coronation came —<br>
And then — 'twas Otherwise —<br><br>
As Carbon in the Coal<br>
And Carbon in the Gem<br>
Are One — and yet the former<br>
Were dull for Diadem —<br><br>
I rose, and all was plain —<br>
But when the Day declined<br>
Myself and It, in Majesty<br>
Were equally — adorned —<br><br>
The Grace that I — was chose —<br>
To Me — surpassed the Crown<br>
That was the Witness for the Grace —<br>
'Twas even that 'twas Mine —</p>
