<p>I got so I could take his name —<br>
Without — Tremendous gain —<br>
That Stop-sensation — on my Soul —<br>
And Thunder — in the Room —<br>
<br>
I got so I could walk across<br>
That Angle in the floor,<br>
Where he turned so, and I turned — how —<br>
And all our Sinew tore —<br>
<br>
I got so I could stir the Box —<br>
In which his letters grew<br>
Without that forcing, in my breath —<br>
As Staples — driven through —<br>
<br>
Could dimly recollect a Grace —<br>
I think, they call it "God" —<br>
Renowned to ease Extremity —<br>
When Formula, had failed —<br>
<br>
And shape my Hands —<br>
Petition's way,<br>
Tho' ignorant of a word<br>
That Ordination — utters —<br>
<br>
My Business, with the Cloud,<br>
If any Power behind it, be,<br>
Not subject to Despair —<br>
It care, in some remoter way,<br>
For so minute affair<br>
As Misery —<br>
Itself, too vast, for interrupting — more —</p>
