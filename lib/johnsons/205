<p>I should not dare to leave my friend,<br>
Because — because if he should die<br>
While I was gone — and I — too late —<br>
Should reach the Heart that wanted me —<br><br>
If I should disappoint the eyes<br>
That hunted — hunted so — to see —<br>
And could not bear to shut until<br>
They "noticed" me — they noticed me —<br><br>
If I should stab the patient faith<br>
So sure I'd come — so sure I'd come —<br>
It listening — listening — went to sleep —<br>
Telling my tardy name —<br><br>
My Heart would wish it broke before —<br>
Since breaking then — since breaking then —<br>
Were useless as next morning's sun —<br>
Where midnight frosts — had lain!</p>
