<p>It's like the Light —<br>
A fashionless Delight —<br>
It's like the Bee —<br>
A dateless — Melody —<br>
<br>
It's like the Woods —<br>
Private — Like the Breeze —<br>
Phraseless — yet it stirs<br>
The proudest Trees —<br>
<br>
It's like the Morning —<br>
Best — when it's done —<br>
And the Everlasting Clocks —<br>
Chime — Noon!</p>
