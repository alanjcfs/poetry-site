<p>For this — accepted Breath —<br>
Through it — compete with Death —<br>
The fellow cannot touch this Crown —<br>
By it — my title take —<br>
Ah, what a royal sake<br>
To my necessity — stooped down!<br>
<br>
No Wilderness — can be<br>
Where this attendeth me —<br>
No Desert Noon —<br>
No fear of frost to come<br>
Haunt the perennial bloom —<br>
But Certain June!<br>
<br>
Get Gabriel — to tell — the royal syllable —<br>
Get Saints — with new — unsteady tongue —<br>
To say what trance below<br>
Most like their glory show —<br>
Fittest the Crown!</p>
