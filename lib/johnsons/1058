<p>Bloom — is Result — to meet a Flower<br>
And casually glance<br>
Would scarcely cause one to suspect<br>
The minor Circumstance<br>
<br>
Assisting in the Bright Affair<br>
So intricately done<br>
Then offered as a Butterfly<br>
To the Meridian —<br>
<br>
To pack the Bud — oppose the Worm —<br>
Obtain its right of Dew —<br>
Adjust the Heat — elude the Wind —<br>
Escape the prowling Bee<br>
<br>
Great Nature not to disappoint<br>
Awaiting Her that Day —<br>
To be a Flower, is profound<br>
Responsibility —</p>
