<p>I see thee better — in the Dark —<br>
I do not need a Light —<br>
The Love of Thee — a Prism be —<br>
Excelling Violet —<br><br>
I see thee better for the Years<br>
That hunch themselves between —<br>
The Miner's Lamp — sufficient be —<br>
To nullify the Mine —<br><br>
And in the Grave — I see Thee best —<br>
Its little Panels be<br>
Aglow — All ruddy — with the Light<br>
I held so high, for Thee —<br><br>
What need of Day —<br>
To Those whose Dark — hath so — surpassing Sun —<br>
It deem it be — Continually —<br>
At the Meridian?</p>
