<p>Somewhere upon the general Earth<br>
Itself exist Today —<br>
The Magic passive but extant<br>
That consecrated me —<br><br>
Indifferent Seasons doubtless play<br>
Where I for right to be —<br>
Would pay each Atom that I am<br>
But Immortality —<br><br>
Reserving that but just to prove<br>
Another Date of Thee —<br>
Oh God of Width, do not for us<br>
Curtail Eternity!</p>
