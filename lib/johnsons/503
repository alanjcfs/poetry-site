<p>Better — than Music! For I — who heard it —<br>
I was used — to the Birds — before —<br>
This — was different — 'Twas Translation —<br>
Of all tunes I knew — and more —<br>
<br>
'Twasn't contained — like other stanza —<br>
No one could play it — the second time —<br>
But the Composer — perfect Mozart —<br>
Perish with him — that Keyless Rhyme!<br>
<br>
So — Children — told how Brooks in Eden —<br>
Bubbled a better — Melody —<br>
Quaintly infer — Eve's great surrender —<br>
Urging the feet — that would — not — fly —<br>
<br>
Children — matured — are wiser — mostly —<br>
Eden — a legend — dimly told —<br>
Eve — and the Anguish — Grandame's story —<br>
But — I was telling a tune — I heard —<br>
<br>
Not such a strain — the Church — baptizes —<br>
When the last Saint — goes up the Aisles —<br>
Not such a stanza splits the silence —<br>
When the Redemption strikes her Bells —<br>
<br>
Let me not spill — its smallest cadence —<br>
Humming — for promise — when alone —<br>
Humming — until my faint Rehearsal —<br>
Drop into tune — around the Throne —</p>
