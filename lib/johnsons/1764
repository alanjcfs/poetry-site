<p>The saddest noise, the sweetest noise,<br>
The maddest noise that grows, —<br>
The birds, they make it in the spring,<br>
At night's delicious close.<br><br>
Between the March and April line —<br>
That magical frontier<br>
Beyond which summer hesitates,<br>
Almost too heavenly near.<br><br>
It makes us think of all the dead<br>
That sauntered with us here,<br>
By separation's sorcery<br>
Made cruelly more dear.<br><br>
It makes us think of what we had,<br>
And what we now deplore.<br>
We almost wish those siren throats<br>
Would go and sing no more.<br><br>
An ear can break a human heart<br>
As quickly as a spear,<br>
We wish the ear had not a heart<br>
So dangerously near.</p>
