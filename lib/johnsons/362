<p>It struck me — every Day —<br>
The Lightning was as new<br>
As if the Cloud that instant slit<br>
And let the Fire through —<br>
<br>
It burned Me — in the Night —<br>
It Blistered to My Dream —<br>
It sickened fresh upon my sight —<br>
With every Morn that came —<br>
<br>
I though that Storm — was brief —<br>
The Maddest — quickest by —<br>
But Nature lost the Date of This —<br>
And left it in the Sky —</p>
