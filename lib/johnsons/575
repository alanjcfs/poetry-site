<p>"Heaven" has different Signs — to me —<br>
Sometimes, I think that Noon<br>
Is but a symbol of the Place —<br>
And when again, at Dawn,<br>
<br>
A mighty look runs round the World<br>
And settles in the Hills —<br>
An Awe if it should be like that<br>
Upon the Ignorance steals —<br>
<br>
The Orchard, when the Sun is on —<br>
The Triumph of the Birds<br>
When they together Victory make —<br>
Some Carnivals of Clouds —<br>
<br>
The Rapture of a finished Day —<br>
Returning to the West —<br>
All these — remind us of the place<br>
That Men call "paradise" —<br>
<br>
Itself be fairer — we suppose —<br>
But how Ourself, shall be<br>
Adorned, for a Superior Grace —<br>
Not yet, our eyes can see —</p>
