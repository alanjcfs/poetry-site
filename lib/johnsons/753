<p>My Soul — accused me — And I quailed —<br>
As Tongue of Diamond had reviled<br>
All else accused me — and I smiled —<br>
My Soul — that Morning — was My friend —<br><br>
Her favor — is the best Disdain<br>
Toward Artifice of Time — or Men —<br>
But Her Disdain — 'twere lighter bear<br>
A finger of Enamelled Fire —</p>
