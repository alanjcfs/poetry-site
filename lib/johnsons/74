<p>A Lady red — amid the Hill<br>
Her annual secret keeps!<br>
A Lady white, within the Field<br>
In placid Lily sleeps!<br><br>
The tidy Breezes, with their Brooms —<br>
Sweep vale — and hill — and tree!<br>
Prithee, My pretty Housewives!<br>
Who may expected be?<br><br>
The Neighbors do not yet suspect!<br>
The Woods exchange a smile!<br>
Orchard, and Buttercup, and Bird —<br>
In such a little while!<br><br>
And yet, how still the Landscape stands!<br>
How nonchalant the Hedge!<br>
As if the "Resurrection"<br>
Were nothing very strange!</p>
