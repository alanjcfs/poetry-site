<p>The Whole of it came not at once —<br>
'Twas Murder by degrees —<br>
A Thrust — and then for Life a chance —<br>
The Bliss to cauterize —<br><br>
The Cat reprieves the Mouse<br>
She eases from her teeth<br>
Just long enough for Hope to tease —<br>
Then mashes it to death —<br><br>
'Tis Life's award — to die —<br>
Contenteder if once —<br>
Than dying half — then rallying<br>
For consciouser Eclipse —</p>
