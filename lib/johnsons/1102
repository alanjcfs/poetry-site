<p>His Bill is clasped — his Eye forsook —<br>
His Feathers wilted low —<br>
The Claws that clung, like lifeless Gloves<br>
Indifferent hanging now —<br>
The Joy that in his happy Throat<br>
Was waiting to be poured<br>
Gored through and through with Death, to be<br>
Assassin of a Bird<br>
Resembles to my outraged mind<br>
The firing in Heaven,<br>
On Angels — squandering for you<br>
Their Miracles of Tune —</p>
