<p>A Murmur in the Trees — to note —<br>
Not loud enough — for Wind —<br>
A Star — not far enough to seek —<br>
Nor near enough — to find —<br><br>
A long — long Yellow — on the Lawn —<br>
A Hubbub — as of feet —<br>
Not audible — as Ours — to Us —<br>
But dapperer — More Sweet —<br><br>
A Hurrying Home of little Men<br>
To Houses unperceived —<br>
All this — and more — if I should tell —<br>
Would never be believed —<br><br>
Of Robins in the Trundle bed<br>
How many I espy<br>
Whose Nightgowns could not hide the Wings —<br>
Although I heard them try —<br><br>
But then I promised ne'er to tell —<br>
How could I break My Word?<br>
So go your Way — and I'll go Mine —<br>
No fear you'll miss the Road.</p>
