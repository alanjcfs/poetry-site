<p>Our journey had advanced —<br>
Our feet were almost come<br>
To that odd Fork in Being's Road —<br>
Eternity — by Term —<br><br>
Our pace took sudden awe —<br>
Our feet — reluctant — led —<br>
Before — were Cities — but Between —<br>
The Forest of the Dead —<br><br>
Retreat — was out of Hope —<br>
Behind — a Sealed Route —<br>
Eternity's White Flag — Before —<br>
And God — at every Gate —</p>
