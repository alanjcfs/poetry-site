<p>It was a Grave, yet bore no Stone<br>
Enclosed 'twas not of Rail<br>
A Consciousness its Acre, and<br>
It held a Human Soul.<br><br>
Entombed by whom, for what offence<br>
If Home or Foreign born â€”<br>
Had I the curiosity<br>
'Twere not appeased of men<br><br>
Till Resurrection, I must guess<br>
Denied the small desire<br>
A Rose upon its Ridge to sow<br>
Or take away a Briar.</p>
