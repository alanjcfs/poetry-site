But gallanter, I know,<br>
Who charge within the bosom,<br>
The cavalry of woe.<br><br>
Who win, and nations do not see,<br>
Who fall, and none observe,<br>
Whose dying eyes no country<br>
Regards with patriot love.<br><br>
We trust, in plumed procession,<br>
For such the angels go,<br>
Rank after rank, with even feet<br>
And uniforms of snow.</p>
