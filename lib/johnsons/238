<p>Kill your Balm — and its Odors bless you —<br>
Bare your Jessamine — to the storm —<br>
And she will fling her maddest perfume —<br>
Haply — your Summer night to Charm —<br>
<br>
Stab the Bird — that built in your bosom —<br>
Oh, could you catch her last Refrain —<br>
Bubble! "forgive" — "Some better" — Bubble!<br>
"Carol for Him — when I am gone"!</p>
