<p>To put this World down, like a Bundle —<br>
And walk steady, away,<br>
Requires Energy — possibly Agony —<br>
'Tis the Scarlet way<br><br>
Trodden with straight renunciation<br>
By the Son of God —<br>
Later, his faint Confederates<br>
Justify the Road —<br><br>
Flavors of that old Crucifixion —<br>
Filaments of Bloom, Pontius Pilate sowed —<br>
Strong Clusters, from Barabbas' Tomb —<br><br>
Sacrament, Saints partook before us —<br>
Patent, every drop,<br>
With the Brand of the Gentile Drinker<br>
Who indorsed the Cup —</p>
