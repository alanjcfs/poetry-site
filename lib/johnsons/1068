<p>Further in Summer than the Birds -<br>
Pathetic from the Grass -<br>
A Minor Nation celebrates<br>
It's unobtrusive Mass -<br><br>
No Ordinance be seen -<br>
So gradual the Grace<br>
A pensive Custom it becomes<br>
Enlarging Loneliness -<br><br>
'Tis Audiblest, at Dusk -<br>
When Day's attempt is done -<br>
And Nature nothing waits to do<br>
But terminate in Tune -<br><br>
Nor difference it knows<br>
Of Cadence, or of Pause -<br>
But simultaneous as Same -<br>
The Service emphacize -<br><br>
Nor know I when it cease -<br>
At Candles, it is here -<br>
When Sunrise is - that it is not -<br>
Than this, I know no more -<br><br>
The Earth has many keys -<br>
Where Melody is not<br>
Is the Unknown Peninsula -<br>
Beauty - is Nature's Fact -<br><br>
But Witness for Her Land -<br>
And Witness for Her Sea -<br>
The Cricket is Her utmost<br>
Of Elegy, to Me -</p>

<p>Further in Summer than the Birds<br>
Pathetic from the Grass<br>
A minor Nation celebrates<br>
It's unobtrusive Mass<br><br>
No Ordinance be seen<br>
So gradual the Grace<br>
A pensive Custom it becomes<br>
Enlarging Loneliness.<br><br>
Antiquer felt at Noon<br>
When August is burning low<br>
Arise this spectral Canticle<br>
Repose to typify<br><br>
Remit as yet no Grace<br>
No Furrow on the Glow<br>
Yet a Druidic - Difference<br>
Enhances Nature now</p>
