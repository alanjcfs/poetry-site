<p>We like March.<br>
His Shoes are Purple —<br>
He is new and high —<br>
Makes he Mud for Dog and Peddler.<br>
Makes he Forests dry.<br>
Knows the Adder Tongue his coming<br>
And presents her Spot —<br>
Stands the Sun so close and mighty<br>
That our Minds are hot.<br><br>
News is he of all the others —<br>
Bold it were to die<br>
With the Blue Birds exercising<br>
On his British Sky.<br><br>

We like March — his shoes are Purple.<br>
He is new and high —<br>
Makes he Mud for Dog and Peddler —<br>
Makes he Forests Dry —<br>
Knows the Adder's Tongue his coming<br>
And begets her spot —<br>
Stands the Sun so close and mighty —<br>
That our Minds are hot.<br>
News is he of all the others —<br>
Bold it were to die<br>
With the Blue Birds buccaneering<br>
On his British sky —</p>
