<p>Through the strait pass of suffering —<br>
The Martyrs — even — trod.<br>
Their feet — upon Temptations —<br>
Their faces — upon God —<br><br>
A stately — shriven — Company —<br>
Convulsion — playing round —<br>
Harmless — as streaks of Meteor —<br>
Upon a Planet's Bond —<br><br>
Their faith — the everlasting troth —<br>
Their Expectation — fair —<br>
The Needle — to the North Degree —<br>
Wades — so — thro' polar Air!</p>
