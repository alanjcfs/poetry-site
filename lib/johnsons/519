<p>'Twas warm — at first — like Us —<br>
Until there crept upon<br>
A Chill — like frost upon a Glass —<br>
Till all the scene — be gone.<br><br>
The Forehead copied Stone —<br>
The Fingers grew too cold<br>
To ache — and like a Skater's Brook —<br>
The busy eyes — congealed —<br><br>
It straightened — that was all —<br>
It crowded Cold to Cold —<br>
It multiplied indifference —<br>
As Pride were all it could —<br><br>
And even when with Cords —<br>
'Twas lowered, like a Weight —<br>
It made no Signal, nor demurred,<br>
But dropped like Adamant.</p>
