<p>If those I loved were lost,<br>
the crier's voice would tell me -<br>
If those I loved were found,<br>
the bells of Ghent would ring,<br><br>
Did those I loved repose,<br>
the Daisy would impel me -<br>
Philip when bewildered -<br>
bore his riddle in -</p>

<p>If those I loved were lost<br>
The Crier's voice w'd tell me -<br>
If those I loved were found<br>
The bells of Ghent w'd ring -<br>
Did those I loved repose<br>
The Daisy would impel me.<br>
Philip - when bewildered<br>
Bore his riddle in!</p>

<p>If those I loved were lost<br>
The Crier's voice would tell me —<br>
If those I loved were found<br>
The bells of Ghent would ring —<br><br>
Did those I loved repose<br>
The Daisy would impel me.<br>
Philip — when bewildered<br>
Bore his riddle in!</p>
