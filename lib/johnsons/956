<p>What shall I do when the Summer troubles —<br>
What, when the Rose is ripe —<br>
What when the Eggs fly off in Music<br>
From the Maple Keep?<br><br>
What shall I do when the Skies a'chirrup<br>
Drop a Tune on me —<br>
When the Bee hangs all Noon in the Buttercup<br>
What will become of me?<br><br>
Oh, when the Squirrel fills His Pockets<br>
And the Berries stare<br>
How can I bear their jocund Faces<br>
Thou from Here, so far?<br><br>
'Twouldn't afflict a Robin —<br>
All His Goods have Wings —<br>
I — do not fly, so wherefore<br>
My Perennial Things?</p>
