<p>We don't cry — Tim and I,<br>
We are far too grand —<br>
But we bolt the door tight<br>
To prevent a friend —<br><br>
Then we hide our brave face<br>
Deep in our hand —<br>
Not to cry — Tim and I —<br>
We are far too grand —<br><br>
Nor to dream — he and me —<br>
Do we condescend —<br>
We just shut our brown eye<br>
To see to the end —<br><br>
Tim — see Cottages —<br>
But, Oh, so high!<br>
Then — we shake — Tim and I —<br>
And lest I — cry —<br><br>
Tim — reads a little Hymn —<br>
And we both pray —<br>
Please, Sir, I and Tim —<br>
Always lost the way!<br><br>
We must die — by and by —<br>
Clergymen say —<br>
Tim — shall — if I — do —<br>
I — too — if he —<br><br>
How shall we arrange it —<br>
Tim — was — so — shy?<br>
Take us simultaneous — Lord —<br>
I — "Tim" — and Me!</p>
