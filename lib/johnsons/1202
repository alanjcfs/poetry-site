<p>The Frost was never seen —<br>
If met, too rapid passed,<br>
Or in too unsubstantial Team —<br>
The Flowers notice first<br><br>
A Stranger hovering round<br>
A Symptom of alarm<br>
In Villages remotely set<br>
But search effaces him<br><br>
Till some retrieveless Night<br>
Our Vigilance at waste<br>
The Garden gets the only shot<br>
That never could be traced.<br><br>
Unproved is much we know —<br>
Unknown the worst we fear —<br>
Of Strangers is the Earth the Inn<br>
Of Secrets is the Air —<br><br>
To analyze perhaps<br>
A Philip would prefer<br>
But Labor vaster than myself<br>
I find it to infer.</p>
