<p>We talked as Girls do —<br>
Fond, and late —<br>
We speculated fair, on every subject, but the Grave —<br>
Of ours, none affair —<br><br>
We handled Destinies, as cool —<br>
As we — Disposers — be —<br>
And God, a Quiet Party<br>
To our Authority —<br><br>
But fondest, dwelt upon Ourself<br>
As we eventual — be —<br>
When Girls to Women, softly raised<br>
We — occupy — Degree —<br><br>
We parted with a contract<br>
To cherish, and to write<br>
But Heaven made both, impossible<br>
Before another night.</p>
