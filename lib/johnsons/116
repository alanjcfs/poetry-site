<p>I had some things that I called mine —<br>
And God, that he called his,<br>
Till, recently a rival Claim<br>
Disturbed these amities.<br>
<br>
The property, my garden,<br>
Which having sown with care,<br>
He claims the pretty acre,<br>
And sends a Bailiff there.<br>
<br>
The station of the parties<br>
Forbids publicity,<br>
But Justice is sublimer<br>
Than arms, or pedigree.<br>
<br>
I'll institute an "Action" —<br>
I'll vindicate the law —<br>
Jove! Choose your counsel —<br>
I retain "Shaw"!</p>
