<p>The Color of the Grave is Green —<br>
The Outer Grave — I mean —<br>
You would not know it from the Field —<br>
Except it own a Stone —<br><br>
To help the fond — to find it —<br>
Too infinite asleep<br>
To stop and tell them where it is —<br>
But just a Daisy — deep —<br><br>
The Color of the Grave is white —<br>
The outer Grave — I mean —<br>
You would not know it from the Drifts —<br>
In Winter — till the Sun —<br><br>
Has furrowed out the Aisles —<br>
Then — higher than the Land<br>
The little Dwelling Houses rise<br>
Where each — has left a friend —<br><br>
The Color of the Grave within —<br>
The Duplicate — I mean —<br>
Not all the Snows could make it white —<br>
Not all the Summers — Green —<br><br>
You've seen the Color — maybe —<br>
Upon a Bonnet bound —<br>
When that you met it with before —<br>
The Ferret — cannot find —</p>
