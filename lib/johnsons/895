<p>A Cloud withdrew from the Sky<br>
Superior Glory be<br>
But that Cloud and its Auxiliaries<br>
Are forever lost to me<br><br>
Had I but further scanned<br>
Had I secured the Glow<br>
In an Hermetic Memory<br>
It had availed me now.<br><br>
Never to pass the Angel<br>
With a glance and a Bow<br>
Till I am firm in Heaven<br>
Is my intention now.</p>
