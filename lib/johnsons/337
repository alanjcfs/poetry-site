<p>I know a place where Summer strives<br>
With such a practised Frost —<br>
She — each year — leads her Daisies back —<br>
Recording briefly — "Lost" —<br><br>
But when the South Wind stirs the Pools<br>
And struggles in the lanes —<br>
Her Heart misgives Her, for Her Vow —<br>
And she pours soft Refrains<br><br>
Into the lap of Adamant —<br>
And spices — and the Dew —<br>
That stiffens quietly to Quartz —<br>
Upon her Amber Shoe —</p>
