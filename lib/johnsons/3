<p>Sic transit gloria mundi<br>
"How doth the busy bee"<br>
Dum vivamus vivamus<br>
I stay mine enemy! —<br><br>
Oh veni vidi vici!<br>
Oh caput cap-a-pie!<br>
And oh "memento mori"<br>
When I am far from thee<br><br>
Hurrah for Peter Parley<br>
Hurrrah for Daniel Boone<br>
Three cheers sir, for the gentleman<br>
Who first observed the moon —<br><br>
Peter put up the sunshine!<br>
Pattie arrange the stars<br>
Tell Luna, tea is waiting<br>
And call your brother Mars —<br><br>
Put down the apple Adam<br>
And come away with me<br>
So shal't thou have a pippin<br>
From off my Father's tree!<br><br>
I climb the "Hill of Science"<br>
I "view the Landscape o'er"<br>
Such transcendental prospect<br>
I ne'er beheld before! —<br><br>
Unto the Legislature<br>
My country bids me go,<br>
I'll take my india rubbers<br>
In case the wind should blow.<br><br>
During my education<br>
It was announced to me<br>
That gravitation stumbling<br>
Fell from an apple tree —<br><br>
The Earth opon it's axis<br>
Was once supposed to turn<br>
By way of a gymnastic<br>
In honor to the sun —<br><br>
It was the brave Columbus<br>
A sailing o'er the tide<br>
Who notified the nations<br>
Of where I would reside<br><br>
Mortality is fatal<br>
Gentility is fine<br>
Rascality, heroic<br>
Insolvency, sublime<br><br>
Our Fathers being weary<br>
Laid down on Bunker Hill<br>
And though full many a morn'g<br>
Yet they are sleeping still<br><br>
The trumpet sir, shall wake them<br>
In streams I see them rise<br>
Each with a solemn musket<br>
A marching to the skies!<br><br>
A coward will remain, Sir,<br>
Until the fight is done;<br>
But an immortal hero<br>
Will take his hat and run.<br><br>
Good bye Sir, I am going<br>
My country calleth me<br>
Allow me Sir, at parting<br>
To wipe my weeping e'e<br><br>
In token of our friendship<br>
Accept this "Bonnie Doon"<br>
And when the hand that pluck'd it<br>
Hath passed beyond the moon<br><br>
The memory of my ashes<br>
Will consolation be<br>
Then farewell Tuscarora<br>
And farewell Sir, to thee.</p>
