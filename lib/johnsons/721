<p>Behind Me — dips Eternity —<br>
Before Me — Immortality —<br>
Myself — the Term between —<br>
Death but the Drift of Eastern Gray,<br>
Dissolving into Dawn away,<br>
Before the West begin —<br>
<br>
'Tis Kingdoms — afterward — they say —<br>
In perfect — pauseless Monarchy —<br>
Whose Prince — is Son of None —<br>
Himself — His Dateless Dynasty —<br>
Himself — Himself diversify —<br>
In Duplicate divine —<br>
<br>
'Tis Miracle before Me — then —<br>
'Tis Miracle behind — between —<br>
A Crescent in the Sea —<br>
With Midnight to the North of Her —<br>
And Midnight to the South of Her —<br>
And Maelstrom — in the Sky —</p>
