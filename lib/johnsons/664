<p>Of all the Souls that stand create —<br>
I have elected — One —<br>
When Sense from Spirit — files away —<br>
And Subterfuge — is done —<br>
When that which is — and that which was —<br>
Apart — intrinsic — stand —<br>
And this brief Drama in the flesh —<br>
Is shifted — like a Sand —<br>
When Figures show their royal Front —<br>
And Mists — are carved away,<br>
Behold the Atom — I preferred —<br>
To all the lists of Clay!</p>
