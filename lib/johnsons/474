<p>They put Us far apart —<br>
As separate as Sea<br>
And Her unsown Peninsula —<br>
We signified "These see" —<br><br>
They took away our Eyes —<br>
They thwarted Us with Guns —<br>
"I see Thee" each responded straight<br>
Through Telegraphic Signs —<br><br>
With Dungeons — They devised —<br>
But through their thickest skill —<br>
And their opaquest Adamant —<br>
Our Souls saw — just as well —<br><br>
They summoned Us to die —<br>
With sweet alacrity<br>
We stood upon our stapled feet —<br>
Condemned — but just — to see —<br><br>
Permission to recant —<br>
Permission to forget —<br>
We turned our backs upon the Sun<br>
For perjury of that —<br><br>
Not Either — noticed Death —<br>
Of Paradise — aware —<br>
Each other's Face — was all the Disc<br>
Each other's setting — saw —</p>
