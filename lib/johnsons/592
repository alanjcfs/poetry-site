<p>What care the Dead, for Chanticleer —<br>
What care the Dead for Day?<br>
'Tis late your Sunrise vex their face —<br>
And Purple Ribaldry — of Morning<br><br>
Pour as blank on them<br>
As on the Tier of Wall<br>
The Mason builded, yesterday,<br>
And equally as cool —<br><br>
What care the Dead for Summer?<br>
The Solstice had no Sun<br>
Could waste the Snow before their Gate —<br>
And knew One Bird a Tune —<br><br>
Could thrill their Mortised Ear<br>
Of all the Birds that be —<br>
This One — beloved of Mankind<br>
Henceforward cherished be —<br><br>
What care the Dead for Winter?<br>
Themselves as easy freeze —<br>
June Noon — as January Night —<br>
As soon the South — her Breeze<br><br>
Of Sycamore — or Cinnamon —<br>
Deposit in a Stone<br>
And put a Stone to keep it Warm —<br>
Give Spices — unto Men —</p>
