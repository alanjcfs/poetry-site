<p>I could bring You Jewels — had I a mind to —<br>
But You have enough — of those —<br>
I could bring You Odors from St. Domingo —<br>
Colors — from Vera Cruz —<br><br>
Berries of the Bahamas — have I —<br>
But this little Blaze<br>
Flickering to itself — in the Meadow —<br>
Suits Me — more than those —<br><br>
Never a Fellow matched this Topaz —<br>
And his Emerald Swing —<br>
Dower itself — for Bobadilo —<br>
Better — Could I bring?</p>
