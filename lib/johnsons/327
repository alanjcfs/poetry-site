<p>Before I got my eye put out<br>
I liked as well to see —<br>
As other Creatures, that have Eyes<br>
And know no other way —<br>
<br>
But were it told to me — Today —<br>
That I might have the sky<br>
For mine — I tell you that my Heart<br>
Would split, for size of me —<br>
<br>
The Meadows — mine —<br>
The Mountains — mine —<br>
All Forests — Stintless Stars —<br>
As much of Noon as I could take<br>
Between my finite eyes —<br>
<br>
The Motions of the Dipping Birds —<br>
The Morning's Amber Road —<br>
For mine — to look at when I liked —<br>
The News would strike me dead —<br>
<br>
So safer — guess — with just my soul<br>
Upon the Window pane —<br>
Where other Creatures put their eyes —<br>
Incautious — of the Sun —</p>
