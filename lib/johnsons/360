<p>Death sets a Thing significant<br>
The Eye had hurried by<br>
Except a perished Creature<br>
Entreat us tenderly<br>
<br>
To ponder little Workmanships<br>
In Crayon, or in Wool,<br>
With "This was last Her fingers did" —<br>
Industrious until —<br>
<br>
The Thimble weighed too heavy —<br>
The stitches stopped — by themselves —<br>
And then 'twas put among the Dust<br>
Upon the Closet shelves —<br>
<br>
A Book I have — a friend gave —<br>
Whose Pencil — here and there —<br>
Had notched the place that pleased Him —<br>
At Rest — His fingers are —<br>
<br>
Now — when I read — I read not —<br>
For interrupting Tears —<br>
Obliterate the Etchings<br>
Too Costly for Repairs.</p>
