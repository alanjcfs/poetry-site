<p>I thought that nature was enough<br>
Till Human nature came<br>
But that the other did absorb<br>
As Parallax a Flame â€”<br><br>
Of Human nature just aware<br>
There added the Divine<br>
Brief struggle for capacity<br>
The power to contain<br><br>
Is always as the contents<br>
But give a Giant room<br>
And you will lodge a Giant<br>
And not a smaller man</p>
