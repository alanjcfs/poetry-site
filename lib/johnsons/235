<p>The Court is far away —<br>
No Umpire — have I —<br>
My Sovereign is offended —<br>
To gain his grace — I'd die!<br><br>
I'll seek his royal feet —<br>
I'll say — Remember — King —<br>
Thou shalt — thyself — one day — a Child —<br>
Implore a larger — thing —<br><br>
That Empire — is of Czars —<br>
As small — they say — as I —<br>
Grant me — that day — the royalty —<br>
To intercede — for Thee —</p>
