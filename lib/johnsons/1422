<p>Summer has two Beginnings —<br>
Beginning once in June —<br>
Beginning in October<br>
Affectingly again —<br><br>
Without, perhaps, the Riot<br>
But graphicker for Grace —<br>
As finer is a going<br>
Than a remaining Face —<br><br>
Departing then — forever —<br>
Forever — until May —<br>
Forever is deciduous<br>
Except to those who die —</p>
