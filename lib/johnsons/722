<p>Sweet Mountains — Ye tell Me no lie —<br>
Never deny Me — Never fly —<br>
Those same unvarying Eyes<br>
Turn on Me — when I fail — or feign,<br>
Or take the Royal names in vain —<br>
Their far — slow — Violet Gaze —<br><br>
My Strong Madonnas — Cherish still —<br>
The Wayward Nun — beneath the Hill —<br>
Whose service — is to You —<br>
Her latest Worship — When the Day<br>
Fades from the Firmament away —<br>
To lift Her Brows on You —</p>
