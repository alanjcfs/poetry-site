<p>I can wade Grief —<br>
Whole Pools of it —<br>
I'm used to that —<br>
But the least push of Joy<br>
Breaks up my feet —<br>
And I tip — drunken —<br>
Let no Pebble — smile —<br>
'Twas the New Liquor —<br>
That was all!<br>
<br>
Power is only Pain —<br>
Stranded, thro' Discipline,<br>
Till Weights — will hang —<br>
Give Balm — to Giants —<br>
And they'll wilt, like Men —<br>
Give Himmaleh —<br>
They'll Carry — Him!</p>
