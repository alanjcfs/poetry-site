<p>Whatever it is — she has tried it —<br>
Awful Father of Love —<br>
Is not Ours the chastising —<br>
Do not chastise the Dove —<br><br>
Not for Ourselves, petition —<br>
Nothing is left to pray —<br>
When a subject is finished —<br>
Words are handed away —<br><br>
Only lest she be lonely<br>
In thy beautiful House<br>
Give her for her Transgression<br>
License to think of us —</p>
