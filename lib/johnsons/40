<p>When I count the seeds<br>
That are sown beneath,<br>
To bloom so, bye and bye —<br>
When I con the people<br>
Lain so low,<br>
To be received as high —<br>
When I believe the garden<br>
Mortal shall not see —<br>
Pick by faith its blossom<br>
And avoid its Bee,<br>
I can spare this summer, unreluctantly.</p>
