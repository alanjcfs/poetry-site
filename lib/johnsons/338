<p>I know that He exists.<br>
Somewhere — in Silence —<br>
He has hid his rare life<br>
From our gross eyes.<br><br>
'Tis an instant's play.<br>
'Tis a fond Ambush —<br>
Just to make Bliss<br>
Earn her own surprise!<br><br>
But — should the play<br>
Prove piercing earnest —<br>
Should the glee — glaze —<br>
In Death's — stiff — stare —<br><br>
Would not the fun<br>
Look too expensive!<br>
Would not the jest —<br>
Have crawled too far!</p>
