<p>Don't put up my Thread and Needle —<br>
I'll begin to Sew<br>
When the Birds begin to whistle —<br>
Better Stitches — so —<br>
<br>
These were bent — my sight got crooked —<br>
When my mind — is plain<br>
I'll do seams — a Queen's endeavor<br>
Would not blush to own —<br>
<br>
Hems — too fine for Lady's tracing<br>
To the sightless Knot —<br>
Tucks — of dainty interspersion —<br>
Like a dotted Dot —<br>
<br>
Leave my Needle in the furrow —<br>
Where I put it down —<br>
I can make the zigzag stitches<br>
Straight — when I am strong —<br>
<br>
Till then — dreaming I am sewing<br>
Fetch the seam I missed —<br>
Closer — so I — at my sleeping —<br>
Still surmise I stitch —</p>
