<p>One need not be a Chamber — to be Haunted —<br>
One need not be a House —<br>
The Brain has Corridors — surpassing<br>
Material Place —<br><br>
Far safer, of a Midnight Meeting<br>
External Ghost<br>
Than its interior Confronting —<br>
That Cooler Host.<br><br>
Far safer, through an Abbey gallop,<br>
The Stones a'chase —<br>
Than Unarmed, one's a'self encounter —<br>
In lonesome Place —<br><br>
Ourself behind ourself, concealed —<br>
Should startle most —<br>
Assassin hid in our Apartment<br>
Be Horror's least.<br><br>
The Body — borrows a Revolver —<br>
He bolts the Door —<br>
O'erlooking a superior spectre —<br>
Or More —</p>
