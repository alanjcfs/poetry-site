<p>I have never seen "Volcanoes" —<br>
But, when Travellers tell<br>
How those old — phlegmatic mountains<br>
Usually so still —<br>
<br>
Bear within — appalling Ordnance,<br>
Fire, and smoke, and gun,<br>
Taking Villages for breakfast,<br>
And appalling Men —<br>
<br>
If the stillness is Volcanic<br>
In the human face<br>
When upon a pain Titanic<br>
Features keep their place —<br>
<br>
If at length the smouldering anguish<br>
Will not overcome —<br>
And the palpitating Vineyard<br>
In the dust, be thrown?<br>
<br>
If some loving Antiquary,<br>
On Resumption Morn,<br>
Will not cry with joy "Pompeii"!<br>
To the Hills return!</p>
