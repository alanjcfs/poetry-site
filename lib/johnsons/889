<p>Crisis is a Hair<br>
Toward which the forces creep<br>
Past which forces retrograde<br>
If it come in sleep<br>
<br>
To suspend the Breath<br>
Is the most we can<br>
Ignorant is it Life or Death<br>
Nicely balancing.<br>
<br>
Let an instant push<br>
Or an Atom press<br>
Or a Circle hesitate<br>
In Circumference<br>
<br>
It — may jolt the Hand<br>
That adjusts the Hair<br>
That secures Eternity<br>
From presenting — Here —</p>
