<p>I think I was enchanted<br>
When first a sombre Girl —<br>
I read that Foreign Lady —<br>
The Dark — felt beautiful —<br><br>
And whether it was noon at night —<br>
Or only Heaven — at Noon —<br>
For very Lunacy of Light<br>
I had not power to tell —<br><br>
The Bees — became as Butterflies —<br>
The Butterflies — as Swans —<br>
Approached — and spurned the narrow Grass —<br>
And just the meanest Tunes<br><br>
That Nature murmured to herself<br>
To keep herself in Cheer —<br>
I took for Giants — practising<br>
Titanic Opera —<br><br>
The Days — to Mighty Metres stept —<br>
The Homeliest — adorned<br>
As if unto a Jubilee<br>
'Twere suddenly Confirmed —<br><br>
I could not have defined the change —<br>
Conversion of the Mind<br>
Like Sanctifying in the Soul —<br>
Is Witnessed — not Explained —<br><br>
'Twas a Divine Insanity —<br>
The Danger to be sane<br>
Should I again experience —<br>
'Tis Antidote to turn —<br><br>
To Tomes of solid Witchcraft —<br>
Magicians be asleep —<br>
But Magic — hath an Element —<br>
Like Deity — to keep —</p>
