<p>That sacred Closet when you sweep —<br>
Entitled "Memory" —<br>
Select a reverential Broom —<br>
And do it silently.<br><br>
'Twill be a Labor of surprise —<br>
Besides Identity<br>
Of other Interlocutors<br>
A probability —<br><br>
August the Dust of that Domain —<br>
Unchallenged — let it lie —<br>
You cannot supersede itself<br>
But it can silence you —</p>
