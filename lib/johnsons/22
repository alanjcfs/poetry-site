<p>All these my banners be.<br>
I sow my pageantry<br>
In May —<br>
It rises train by train —<br>
Then sleeps in state again —<br>
My chancel — all the plain<br>
Today.<br><br>
To lose — if one can find again —<br>
To miss — if one shall meet —<br>
The Burglar cannot rob — then —<br>
The Broker cannot cheat.<br>
So build the hillocks gaily<br>
Thou little spade of mine<br>
Leaving nooks for Daisy<br>
And for Columbine —<br>
You and I the secret<br>
Of the Crocus know —<br>
Let us chant it softly —<br>
"There is no more snow!"<br><br>
To him who keeps an Orchis' heart —<br>
The swamps are pink with June.</p>
