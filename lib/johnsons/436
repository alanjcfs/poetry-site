<p>The Wind — tapped like a tired Man —<br>
And like a Host — "Come in"<br>
I boldly answered — entered then<br>
My Residence within<br><br>
A Rapid — footless Guest —<br>
To offer whom a Chair<br>
Were as impossible as hand<br>
A Sofa to the Air —<br><br>
No Bone had He to bind Him —<br>
His Speech was like the Push<br>
Of numerous Humming Birds at once<br>
From a superior Bush —<br><br>
His Countenance — a Billow —<br>
His Fingers, as He passed<br>
Let go a music — as of tunes<br>
Blown tremulous in Glass —<br><br>
He visited — still flitting —<br>
Then like a timid Man<br>
Again, He tapped — 'twas flurriedly —<br>
And I became alone —</p>
