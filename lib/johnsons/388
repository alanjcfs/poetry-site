<p>Take your Heaven further on —<br>
This — to Heaven divine Has gone —<br>
Had You earlier blundered in<br>
Possibly, e'en You had seen<br>
An Eternity — put on —<br>
Now — to ring a Door beyond<br>
Is the utmost of Your Hand —<br>
To the Skies — apologize —<br>
Nearer to Your Courtesies<br>
Than this Sufferer polite —<br>
Dressed to meet You —<br>
See — in White!</p>
