<p>Forever at His side to walk —<br>
The smaller of the two!<br>
Brain of His Brain —<br>
Blood of His Blood —<br>
Two lives — One Being — now —<br>
<br>
Forever of His fate to taste —<br>
If grief — the largest part —<br>
If joy — to put my piece away<br>
For that beloved Heart —<br>
<br>
All life — to know each other —<br>
Whom we can never learn —<br>
And bye and bye — a Change —<br>
Called Heaven —<br>
Rapt Neighborhoods of Men —<br>
Just finding out — what puzzled us —<br>
Without the lexicon!</p>
