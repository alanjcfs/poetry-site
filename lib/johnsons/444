<p>It feels a shame to be Alive —<br>
When Men so brave — are dead —<br>
One envies the Distinguished Dust —<br>
Permitted — such a Head —<br>
<br>
The Stone — that tells defending Whom<br>
This Spartan put away<br>
What little of Him we — possessed<br>
In Pawn for Liberty —<br>
<br>
The price is great — Sublimely paid —<br>
Do we deserve — a Thing —<br>
That lives — like Dollars — must be piled<br>
Before we may obtain?<br>
<br>
Are we that wait — sufficient worth —<br>
That such Enormous Pearl<br>
As life — dissolved be — for Us —<br>
In Battle's — horrid Bowl?<br>
<br>
It may be — a Renown to live —<br>
I think the Man who die —<br>
Those unsustained — Saviors —<br>
Present Divinity —</p>
