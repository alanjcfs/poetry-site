<p>The Battle fought between the Soul<br>
And No Man — is the One<br>
Of all the Battles prevalent —<br>
By far the Greater One —<br><br>
No News of it is had abroad —<br>
Its Bodiless Campaign<br>
Establishes, and terminates —<br>
Invisible — Unknown —<br><br>
Nor History — record it —<br>
As Legions of a Night<br>
The Sunrise scatters — These endure —<br>
Enact — and terminate —</p>
