<p>It sounded as if the Streets were running<br>
And then — the Streets stood still —<br>
Eclipse — was all we could see at the Window<br>
And Awe — was all we could feel.<br><br>
By and by — the boldest stole out of his Covert<br>
To see if Time was there —<br>
Nature was in an Opal Apron,<br>
Mixing fresher Air.</p>
