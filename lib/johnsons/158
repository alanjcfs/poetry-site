<p>Dying! Dying in the night!<br>
Won't somebody bring the light<br>
So I can see which way to go<br>
Into the everlasting snow?<br><br>
And "Jesus"! Where is Jesus gone?<br>
They said that Jesus — always came —<br>
Perhaps he doesn't know the House —<br>
This way, Jesus, Let him pass!<br><br>
Somebody run to the great gate<br>
And see if Dollie's coming! Wait!<br>
I hear her feet upon the stair!<br>
Death won't hurt — now Dollie's here!</p>
