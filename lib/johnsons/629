<p>I watched the Moon around the House<br>
Until upon a Pane —<br>
She stopped — a Traveller's privilege — for Rest —<br>
And there upon<br><br>
I gazed — as at a stranger —<br>
The Lady in the Town<br>
Doth think no incivility<br>
To lift her Glass — upon —<br><br>
But never Stranger justified<br>
The Curiosity<br>
Like Mine — for not a Foot — nor Hand —<br>
Nor Formula — had she —<br><br>
But like a Head — a Guillotine<br>
Slid carelessly away —<br>
Did independent, Amber —<br>
Sustain her in the sky —<br><br>
Or like a Stemless Flower —<br>
Upheld in rolling Air<br>
By finer Gravitations —<br>
Than bind Philosopher —<br><br>
No Hunger — had she — nor an Inn —<br>
Her Toilette — to suffice —<br>
Nor Avocation — nor Concern<br>
For little Mysteries<br><br>
As harass us — like Life — and Death —<br>
And Afterwards — or Nay —<br>
But seemed engrossed to Absolute —<br>
With shining — and the Sky —<br><br>
The privilege to scrutinize<br>
Was scarce upon my Eyes<br>
When, with a Silver practise —<br>
She vaulted out of Gaze —<br><br>
And next — I met her on a Cloud —<br>
Myself too far below<br>
To follow her superior Road —<br>
Or its advantage — Blue —</p>
