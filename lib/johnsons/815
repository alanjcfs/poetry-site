<p>The Luxury to apprehend<br>
The Luxury 'twould be<br>
To look at Thee a single time<br>
An Epicure of Me<br><br>
In whatsoever Presence makes<br>
Till for a further Food<br>
I scarcely recollect to starve<br>
So first am I supplied â€”<br><br>
The Luxury to meditate<br>
The Luxury it was<br>
To banguet on thy Countenance<br>
A Sumptuousness bestows<br><br>
On plainer Days, whose Table far<br>
As Certainty can see<br>
Is laden with a single Crumb<br>
The Consciousness of Thee.</p>
