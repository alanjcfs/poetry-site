<p>The Birds begun at Four o'clock —<br>
Their period for Dawn —<br>
A Music numerous as space —<br>
But neighboring as Noon —<br><br>
I could not count their Force —<br>
Their Voices did expend<br>
As Brook by Brook bestows itself<br>
To multiply the Pond.<br><br>
Their Witnesses were not —<br>
Except occasional man —<br>
In homely industry arrayed —<br>
To overtake the Morn —<br><br>
Nor was it for applause —<br>
That I could ascertain —<br>
But independent Ecstasy<br>
Of Deity and Men —<br><br>
By Six, the Flood had done —<br>
No Tumult there had been<br>
Of Dressing, or Departure —<br>
And yet the Band was gone —<br><br>
The Sun engrossed the East —<br>
The Day controlled the World —<br>
The Miracle that introduced<br>
Forgotten, as fulfilled.</p>
