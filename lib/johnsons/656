<p>The name — of it — is "Autumn" —<br>
The hue — of it — is Blood —<br>
An Artery — upon the Hill —<br>
A Vein — along the Road —<br><br>
Great Globules — in the Alleys —<br>
And Oh, the Shower of Stain —<br>
When Winds — upset the Basin —<br>
And spill the Scarlet Rain —<br><br>
It sprinkles Bonnets — far below —<br>
It gathers ruddy Pools —<br>
Then — eddies like a Rose — away —<br>
Upon Vermilion Wheels —</p>
