<p>To die — takes just a little while —<br>
They say it doesn't hurt —<br>
It's only fainter — by degrees —<br>
And then — it's out of sight —<br><br>
A darker Ribbon — for a Day —<br>
A Crape upon the Hat —<br>
And then the pretty sunshine comes —<br>
And helps us to forget —<br><br>
The absent — mystic — creature —<br>
That but for love of us —<br>
Had gone to sleep — that soundest time —<br>
Without the weariness —</p>
