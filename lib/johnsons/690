<p>Victory comes late —<br>
And is held low to freezing lips —<br>
Too rapt with frost<br>
To take it —<br>
How sweet it would have tasted —<br>
Just a Drop —<br>
Was God so economical?<br>
His Table's spread too high for Us —<br>
Unless We dine on tiptoe —<br>
Crumbs — fit such little mouths —<br>
Cherries — suit Robbins —<br>
The Eagle's Golden Breakfast strangles — Them —<br>
God keep His Oath to Sparrows —<br>
Who of little Love — know how to starve —</p>
