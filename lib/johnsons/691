<p>Would you like summer? Taste of ours.<br>
Spices? Buy here!<br>
Ill! We have berries, for the parching!<br>
Weary! Furloughs of down!<br>
Perplexed! Estates of violet trouble ne'er looked on!<br>
Captive! We bring reprieve of roses!<br>
Fainting! Flasks of air!<br>
Even for Death, a fairy medicine.<br>
But, which is it, sir?</p>
