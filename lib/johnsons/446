<p>I showed her Heights she never saw —<br>
"Would'st Climb," I said?<br>
She said — "Not so" —<br>
"With me —" I said — With me?<br>
I showed her Secrets — Morning's Nest —<br>
The Rope the Nights were put across —<br>
And now — "Would'st have me for a Guest?"<br>
She could not find her Yes —<br>
And then, I brake my life — And Lo,<br>
A Light, for her, did solemn glow,<br>
The larger, as her face withdrew —<br>
And could she, further, "No"?</p>
